<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>This book originated in a series of eight lectures on
Russian Literature during the Nineteenth Century
which I delivered in March, 1901, at the Lowell
Institute, in Boston.</p>

<p>In accepting the invitation to deliver this course, I fully
realised the difficulties which stood in my way. It is by no
means an easy task to speak or to write about the literature of
a country, when this literature is hardly known to the audience
or to the readers. Only three or four Russian writers
have been properly and at all completely translated into English;
so that very often I had to speak <i>about</i> a poem or a
novel, when it could have been readily characterised by
simply reading a passage or two <i>from</i> it.</p>

<p>However, if the difficulties were great, the subject was
well worth an effort. Russian literature is a rich mine of
original poetic thought. It has a freshness and youthfulness
which is not found to the same extent in older literatures. It
has, moreover, a sincerity and simplicity of expression which
render it all the more attractive to the mind that has grown
sick of literary artificiality. And it has this distinctive feature,
that it brings within the domain of Art—the poem, the novel,
the drama—nearly all those questions, social and political,
which in Western Europe and America, at least in our
present generation, are discussed chiefly in the political
writings of the day, but seldom in literature.</p>

<p>In no other country does literature occupy so influential a
position as it does in Russia. Nowhere else does it exercise so
profound and so direct an influence upon the intellectual
development of the younger generation. There are novels of
Turguéneff, and even of the less-known writers, which have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
been real stepping stones in the development of Russian
youth within the last fifty years.</p>

<p>The reason why literature exercises such an influence in
Russia is self-evident. There is no open political life, and with
the exception of a few years at the time of the abolition of
serfdom, the Russian people have never been called upon to
take an active part in the framing of their country’s institutions.</p>

<p>The consequence has been that the best minds of the country
have chosen the poem, the novel, the satire, or literary
criticism as the medium for expressing their aspirations,
their conceptions of national life, or their ideals. It is not to
blue-books, or to newspaper leaders, but to its works of Art
that one must go in Russia in order to understand the political,
economical, and social ideals of the country—the aspirations
of the history-making portions of Russian society.</p>

<p>As it would have been impossible to exhaust so wide a
subject as Russian Literature within the limits of this book,
I have concentrated my chief attention upon the modern
literature. The early writers, down to Púshkin and Gógol—the
founders of the modern literature—are dealt with in a
short introductory sketch. The most representative writers in
poetry, the novel, the drama, political literature, and art
criticism, are considered next, and round them I have grouped
the less prominent writers, of whom the most important are
mentioned in short notes. I am fully aware that every one
of the latter presents something individual and well worth
knowing; and that some of the less-known authors have even
succeeded occasionally in better representing a given current
of thought than their more famous colleagues; but in a book
which is intended to give only a broad, general idea of the
subject, the plan I have pursued was necessary.</p>

<p>Literary criticism has always been well represented in
Russia, and the views taken in this book must needs bear
traces of the work of our great critics—Byelínskiy, Tchernyshévskiy,
Dobrolúboff, and Písareff, and their modern followers,
Mikhailóvsky, Arsénieff, Skabitchévskiy, Venguéroff,
and others. For biographical data concerning contemporary
writers I am indebted to the excellent work on modern
Russian literature by the last named author, and to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
eighty volumes of the admirable <i>Russian Encyclopædic Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to express my hearty thanks to
my old friend, Mr. Richard Heath, who was kind enough
to read over all this book, both in manuscript and in proof.</p>

<p>One of the last messages which Turguéneff addressed
to Russian writers from his death-bed was to
implore them to keep in its purity “that precious
inheritance of ours—the Russian language.” He
who knew in perfection most of the languages spoken in
Western Europe had the highest opinion of Russian as
an instrument for the expression of all possible shades of
thought and feeling, and he had shown in his writings
what depth and force of expression, and what melodiousness
of prose, could be obtained in his native tongue. In his
high appreciation of Russian, Turguéneff—as will often
be seen in these pages—was perfectly right. The richness
of the Russian language in words is astounding: many a
word which stands alone for the expression of a given idea
in the languages of Western Europe has in Russian three or
four equivalents for the rendering of the various shades of
the same idea. It is especially rich for rendering various
shades of human feeling—tenderness and love, sadness and
merriment—as also various degrees of the same action. Its
pliability for translation is such that in no other language do
we find an equal number of most beautiful, correct, and truly
poetical renderings of foreign authors. Poets of the most
diverse character, such as Heine and Béranger, Longfellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and Schiller, Shelley and Goethe—to say nothing of that
favourite with Russian translators, Shakespeare—are equally
well turned into Russian. The sarcasm of Voltaire, the rollicking
humour of Dickens, the good-natured laughter of Cervantes
are rendered with equal ease. Moreover, owing to the
musical character of the Russian tongue, it is wonderfully
adapted for rendering poetry in the same metres as those of
the original. Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” (in two different
translations, both admirable), Heine’s capricious lyrics,
Schiller’s ballads, the melodious folk-songs of different nationalities,
and Béranger’s playful <i>chansonnettes</i>, read in Russian
with exactly the same rhythms as in the originals. The desperate
vagueness of German metaphysics is quite as much at
home in Russian as the matter-of-fact style of the eighteenth
century philosophers; and the short, concrete and expressive,
terse sentences of the best English writers offer no difficulty
for the Russian translator.</p>

<p>Together with Czech and Polish, Moravian, Serbian and
Bulgarian, as also several minor tongues, the Russian belongs
to the great Slavonian family of languages which, in its
turn—together with the Scandinavo-Saxon and the Latin
families, as also the Lithuanian, the Persian, the Armenian,
the Georgian—belongs to the great Indo-European, or
Aryan branch. Some day—soon, let us hope: the sooner
the better—the treasures of both the folk-songs possessed
by the South Slavonians and the many centuries old literature
of the Czechs and the Poles will be revealed to Western
readers. But in this work I have to concern myself
only with the literature of the Eastern, <i>i. e.</i>, the Russian,
branch of the great Slavonian family; and in this branch I
shall have to omit both the South-Russian or Ukraïnian literature
and the White or West-Russian folk-lore and songs. I
shall treat only of the literature of the Great-Russians; or,
simply, the Russians. Of all the Slavonian languages theirs
is the most widely spoken. It is the language of Púshkin and
Lérmontoff, Turguéneff and Tolstóy.</p>

<p>Like all other languages, the Russian has adopted many
foreign words: Scandinavian, Turkish, Mongolian, and,
lately, Greek and Latin. But notwithstanding the assimilation
of many nations and stems of the Ural-Altayan or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Turanian stock which has been accomplished in the course
of ages by the Russian nation, her language has remained
remarkably pure. It is striking indeed to see how the translation
of the Bible which was made in the ninth century into
the language currently spoken by the Moravians and the
South Slavonians remains comprehensible, down to the
present time, to the average Russian. Grammatical forms
and the construction of sentences are indeed quite different
now. But the roots, as well as a very considerable number
of words, remain the same as those which were used in
current talk a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>It must be said that the South-Slavonian had attained a
high degree of perfection, even at that early time. Very
few words of the Gospels had to be rendered in Greek—and
these are names of things unknown to the South Slavonians;
while for none of the abstract words, and for none of
the poetical images of the original, had the translators any
difficulty in finding the proper expressions. Some of the
words they used are, moreover, of a remarkable beauty, and
this beauty has not been lost even to-day. Everyone remembers,
for instance, the difficulty which the learned Dr. Faust,
in Goethe’s immortal tragedy, found in rendering the
sentence: “In the beginning was the Word.” “Word,”
in modern German, seemed to Dr. Faust to be too shallow
an expression for the idea of “the Word being God.” In
the old Slavonian translation we have “Slóvo,” which also
means “Word,” but has at the same time, even for the
modern Russian, a far deeper meaning than that of <i>das
Wort</i>. In old Slavonian “Slóvo” included also the meaning
of “Intellect”—German <i>Vernunft</i>; and consequently it
conveyed to the reader an idea which was deep enough not to
clash with the second part of the Biblical sentence.</p>

<p>I wish that I could give here an idea of the beauty of the
structure of the Russian language, such as it was spoken early
in the eleventh century in North Russia, a sample of which
has been preserved in the sermon of a Nóvgorod bishop
(1035). The short sentences of this sermon, calculated to be
understood by a newly christened flock, are really beautiful;
while the bishop’s conceptions of Christianity, utterly devoid
of Byzantine gnosticism, are most characteristic of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
manner in which Christianity was and is still understood by
the masses of the Russian folk.</p>

<p>At the present time, the Russian language (the Great-Russian)
is remarkably free from <i>patois</i>. Little-Russian, or
Ukraïnian,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which is spoken by nearly 15,000,000 people,
and has its own literature—folk-lore and modern—is
undoubtedly a separate language, in the same sense as
Norwegian and Danish are separate from Swedish, or as
Portuguese and Catalonian are separate from Castilian or
Spanish. White-Russian, which is spoken in some provinces
of Western Russia, has also the characteristics of a separate
branch of the Russian, rather than those of a local dialect.
As to Great-Russian, or Russian, it is spoken by a compact
body of nearly eighty million people in Northern, Central,
Eastern, and Southern Russia, as also in Northern Caucasia
and Siberia. Its pronunciation slightly varies in different
parts of this large territory; nevertheless the literary
language of Púshkin, Gógol, Turguéneff, and Tolstóy is
understood by all this enormous mass of people. The Russian
classics circulate in the villages by millions of copies, and
when, a few years ago, the literary property in Púshkin’s
works came to an end (fifty years after his death), complete
editions of his works—some of them in ten volumes—were
circulated by the hundred-thousand, at the almost incredibly
low price of three shillings (75 cents) the ten volumes; while
millions of copies of his separate poems and tales are sold
now by thousands of ambulant booksellers in the villages, at
the price of from one to three farthings each. Even the
complete works of Gógol, Turguéneff, and Goncharóff, in
twelve-volume editions, have sometimes sold to the number
of 200,000 sets each, in the course of a single year. The
advantages of this intellectual unity of the nation are self-evident.</p>

<h3>EARLY FOLK-LITERATURE: FOLK-LORE—SONGS—SAGAS</h3>

<p>The early folk-literature of Russia, part of which is still
preserved in the memories of the people alone, is wonderfully
rich and full of the deepest interest. No nation of
Western Europe possesses such an astonishing wealth of
traditions, tales, and lyric folk-songs—some of them of the
greatest beauty—and such a rich cycle of archaic epic songs,
as Russia does. Of course, all European nations have had,
once upon a time, an equally rich folk-literature; but the
great bulk of it was lost before scientific explorers had understood
its value or begun to collect it. In Russia, this treasure
was preserved in remote villages untouched by civilisation,
especially in the region round Lake Onéga; and when the
folk-lorists began to collect it, in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, they found in Northern Russia and in
Little Russia old bards still going about the villages with
their primitive string instruments, and reciting poems of a
very ancient origin.</p>

<p>Besides, a variety of very old songs are sung still by the
village folk themselves. Every annual holiday—Christmas,
Easter, Midsummer Day—has its own cycle of songs, which
have been preserved, with their melodies, even from pagan
times. At each marriage, which is accompanied by a very
complicated ceremonial, and at each burial, similarly old
songs are sung by the peasant women. Many of them have,
of course, deteriorated in the course of ages; of many others
mere fragments have survived; but, mindful of the popular
saying that “never a word must be cast out of a song,” the
women in many localities continue to sing the most antique
songs in full, even though the meaning of many of the words
has already been lost.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, the <i>tales</i>. Many of them are certainly
the same as we find among all nations of Aryan origin: one
may read them in Grimm’s collection of fairy tales; but
others came also from the Mongols and the Turks; while
some of them seem to have a purely Russian origin. And next
come the songs recited by wandering singers—the <i>Kalíki</i>—also
very ancient. They are entirely borrowed from the
East, and deal with heroes and heroines of other nationalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
than the Russian, such as “Akib, the Assyrian King,” the
beautiful Helen, Alexander the Great, or Rustem of Persia.
The interest which these Russian versions of Eastern legends
and tales offer to the explorer of folk-lore and mythology
is self-evident.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the epic songs: the <i>bylíny</i>, which correspond
to the Icelandic <i>sagas</i>. Even at the present day they
are sung in the villages of Northern Russia by special
bards who accompany themselves with a special instrument,
also of very ancient origin. The old singer utters in a
sort of recitative one or two sentences, accompanying himself
with his instrument; then follows a melody, into which
each individual singer introduces modulations of his own,
before he resumes next the quiet recitative of the epic narrative.
Unfortunately, these old bards are rapidly disappearing;
but some five-and-thirty years ago a few of them were
still alive in the province of Olónets, to the north-east of
St. Petersburg, and I once heard one of them, whom A.
Hilferding had brought to the capital, and who sang before
the Russian Geographical Society his wonderful ballads. The
collecting of the epic songs was happily begun in good time—during
the eighteenth century—and it has been eagerly
continued by specialists, so that Russia possesses now perhaps
the richest collection of such songs—about four hundred—which
has been saved from oblivion.</p>

<p>The heroes of the Russian epic songs are knights-errant,
whom popular tradition unites round the table of the Kieff
Prince, Vladímir the Fair Sun. Endowed with supernatural
physical force, these knights, Ilyiá of Múrom, Dobrýnia
Nikítich, Nicholas the Villager, Alexéi the Priest’s Son, and
so on, are represented going about Russia, clearing the country
of giants, who infested the land, or of Mongols and
Turks. Or else they go to distant lands to fetch a bride for
the chief of their <i>schola</i>, the Prince Vladímir, or for themselves;
and they meet, of course, on their journeys, with all
sorts of adventures, in which witchcraft plays an important
part. Each of the heroes of these sagas has his own individuality.
For instance, Ilyiá, the Peasant’s Son, does not
care for gold or riches: he fights only to clear the land
from giants and strangers. Nicholas the Villager is the personificatlon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
of the force with which the tiller of the soil is
endowed: nobody can pull out of the ground his heavy
plough, while he himself lifts it with one hand and throws it
above the clouds; Dobrýnia embodies some of the features
of the dragon-fighters, to whom belongs St. George; Sádko
is the personification of the rich merchant, and Tchurílo of
the refined, handsome, urbane man with whom all women
fall in love.</p>

<p>At the same time, in each of these heroes, there are doubtless
mythological features. Consequently, the early Russian
explorers of the <i>bylíny</i>, who worked under the influence of
Grimm, endeavoured to explain them as fragments of an
old Slavonian mythology, in which the forces of Nature are
personified in heroes. In Iliyá they found the features of the
God of the Thunders. Dobrýnia the Dragon-Killer was
supposed to represent the sun in its passive power—the
active powers of fighting being left to Iliyá. Sádko was the
personification of navigation, and the Sea-God whom he
deals with was Neptune. Tchurílo was taken as a representative
of the demoniacal element. And so on. Such was, at
least, the interpretation put upon the <i>sagas</i> by the early
explorers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">V. V. Stásoff</span>, in his <i>Origin of the Russian Bylíny</i>
(1868), entirely upset this theory. With a considerable
wealth of argument he proved that these epic songs are not
fragments of a Slavonic mythology, but represent borrowings
from Eastern tales. Iliyá is the Rustem of the Iranian
legends, placed in Russian surroundings. Dobrýnia is the
Krishna of Indian folk-lore; Sádko is the merchant of the
Eastern tales, as also of a Norman tale. All the Russian epic
heroes have an Eastern origin. Other explorers went still
further than Stásoff. They saw in the heroes of Russian epics
insignificant men who had lived in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries (Iliyá of Múrom is really mentioned as a
historic person in a Scandinavian chronicle), to whom the
exploits of Eastern heroes, borrowed from Eastern tales,
were attributed. Consequently, the heroes of the <i>bylíny</i> could
have had nothing to do with the times of Vladímir, and still
less with the earlier Slavonic mythology.</p>

<p>The gradual evolution and migration of myths, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
successively fastened upon new and local persons as they
reach new countries, may perhaps aid to explain these contradictions.
That there are mythological features in the
heroes of the Russian epics may be taken as certain; only,
the mythology they belong to is not Slavonian but Aryan altogether.
Out of these mythological representations of the
forces of Nature, human heroes were gradually evolved in
the East.</p>

<p>At a later epoch when these Eastern traditions began
to spread in Russia, the exploits of their heroes were attributed
to Russian men, who were made to act in Russian
surroundings. Russian folk-lore assimilated them; and, while
it retained their deepest semi-mythological features and
leading traits of character, it endowed, at the same time, the
Iranian Rustem, the Indian dragon-killer, the Eastern merchant,
and so on, with new features, purely Russian. It
divested them, so to say, of the garb which had been put
upon their mystical substances when they were first appropriated
and humanised by the Iranians and the Indians, and
dressed them now in a Russian garb—just as in the tales
about Alexander the Great, which I heard in Transbaikalia,
the Greek hero is endowed with Buryate features and his
exploits are located on such and such a Transbaikalian mountain.
However, Russian folk-lore did not simply change the
dress of the Persian prince, Rustem, into that of a Russian
peasant, Iliyá. The Russian <i>sagas</i>, in their style, in the poetical
images they resort to, and partly in the characteristics of
their heroes, were new creations. Their heroes are thoroughly
Russian: for instance, they never seek for blood-vengeance,
as Scandinavian heroes would do; their actions, especially
those of “the elder heroes,” are not dictated by personal aims,
but are imbued with a communal spirit, which is characteristic
of Russian popular life. They are as much Russians as
Rustem was Persian. As to the time of composition of these
sagas, it is generally believed that they date from the tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth centuries, but that they received their
definite shape—the one that has reached us—in the fourteenth
century. Since that time they have undergone but little
alteration.</p>

<p>In these <i>sagas</i> Russia has thus a precious national inheritance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of a rare poetical beauty, which has been fully
appreciated in England by Ralston, and in France by the
historian Rambaud.</p>

<h3>“LAY OF IGOR’S RAID”</h3>

<p>And yet Russia has not her Iliad. There has been no
poet to inspire himself with the exploits of Iliyá, Dobrýnia,
Sádko, Tchurílo, and the others, and to make out of them
a poem similar to the epics of Homer, or the “Kalevála” of
the Finns. This has been done with only one cycle of traditions:
in the poem, <i>The Lay of Igor’s Raid</i> (<i>Slóvo o Polkú
Igoreve</i>).</p>

<p>This poem was composed at the end of the twelfth century,
or early in the thirteenth (its full manuscript, destroyed
during the conflagration of Moscow in 1812, dated from the
fourteenth or the fifteenth century). It was undoubtedly the
work of one author, and for its beauty and poetical form it
stands by the side of the <i>Song of the Nibelungs</i>, or the <i>Song
of Roland</i>. It relates a real fact that did happen in 1185.
Igor, a prince of Kíeff, starts with his <i>drúzhina</i> (<i>schola</i>) of
warriors to make a raid on the Pólovtsi, who occupied the
prairies of South-eastern Russia, and continually raided the
Russian villages. All sorts of bad omens are seen on the
march through the prairies—the sun is darkened and casts
its shadow on the band of Russian warriors; the animals give
different warnings; but Igor exclaims: “Brothers and
friends: Better to fall dead than be prisoners of the Pólovtsi!
Let us march to the blue waters of the Don. Let us break our
lances against those of the Pólovtsi. And either I leave there
my head, or I will drink the water of the Don from my
golden helmet.” The march is resumed, the Pólovtsi are met
with, and a great battle is fought.</p>

<p>The description of the battle, in which all Nature takes
part—the eagles and the wolves, and the foxes who bark
after the red shields of the Russians—is admirable. Igor’s
band is defeated. “From sunrise to sunset, and from sunset
to sunrise, the steel arrows flew, the swords clashed on the
helmets, the lances were broken in a far-away land—the land
of the Pólovtsi.” “The black earth under the hoofs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
horses was strewn with bones, and out of this sowing affliction
will rise in the land of the Russians.”</p>

<p>Then comes one of the best bits of early Russian poetry—the
lamentations of Yaroslávna, Igor’s wife, who waits for
his return in the town of Putívl:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The voice of Yaroslávna resounds as the complaint of a cuckoo;
it resounds at the rise of the sunlight.</p>

<p>“I will fly as a cuckoo down the river. I will wet my beaver
sleeves in the Káyala; I will wash with them the wounds of my
prince—the deep wounds of my hero.</p>

<p>“Yaroslávna laments on the walls of Putívl.</p>

<p>“Oh, Wind, terrible Wind! Why dost thou, my master, blow so
strong? Why didst thou carry on thy light wings the arrows of the
Khan against the warriors of my hero? Is it not enough for thee to
blow there, high up in the clouds? Not enough to rock the ships
on the blue sea? Why didst thou lay down my beloved upon the
grass of the Steppes?</p>

<p>“Yaroslávna laments upon the walls of Putívl.</p>

<p>“Oh, glorious Dniéper, thou hast pierced thy way through the
rocky hills to the land of Pólovtsi. Thou hast carried the boats of
Svyatosláv as they went to fight the Khan Kobyák. Bring, oh, my
master, my husband back to me, and I will send no more tears through
thy tide towards the sea.</p>

<p>“Yaroslávna laments upon the walls of Putívl.</p>

<p>“Brilliant Sun, thrice brilliant Sun! Thou givest heat to all,
thou shinest for all. Why shouldest thou send thy burning rays
upon my husband’s warriors? Why didst thou, in the waterless
steppe, dry up their bows in their hands? Why shouldest thou,
making them suffer from thirst, cause their arrows to weigh so heavy
upon their shoulders?”</p>
</div>

<p>This little fragment gives some idea of the general character
and beauty of the <i>Saying about Igor’s Raid</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>Surely this poem was not the only one that was composed
and sung in those times. The introduction itself speaks of
bards, and especially of one, Bayán, whose recitations and
songs are compared to the wind that blows in the tops of the
trees. Many such Bayáns surely went about and sang similar
“Sayings” during the festivals of the princes and their
warriors. Unfortunately, only this one has reached us. The
Russian Church, especially in the fifteenth, sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, pitilessly proscribed the singing of all
the epic songs which circulated among the people: it considered
them “pagan,” and inflicted the heaviest penalties
upon the bards and those who sang old songs in their rings.
Consequently, only small fragments of this early folk-lore
have reached us.</p>

<p>And yet even these few relics of the past have exercised
a powerful influence upon Russian literature, ever since it
has taken the liberty of treating other subjects than purely
religious ones. If Russian versification took the rhythmical
form, as against the syllabic, it was because this form was
imposed upon the Russian poets by the folk-song. Besides,
down to quite recent times, folk-songs constituted such an important
item in Russian country life, in the homes alike of
the landlord and the peasant, that they could not but deeply
influence the Russian poets; and the first great poet of Russia,
Púshkin, began his career by re-telling in verse his old
nurse’s tales to which he used to listen during the long winter
nights. It is also owing to our almost incredible wealth
of most musical popular songs that we have had in Russia,
since so early a date as 1835, an opera (Verstóvskiy’s
<i>Askóld’s Grave</i>), based upon popular tradition, of which the
purely Russian melodies at once catch the ear of the least
musically-educated Russian. This is also why the operas of
Dargomýzhsky and the younger composers are now successfully
sung in the villages to peasant audiences and with local
peasant choirs.</p>

<p>The folk-lore and the folk-song have thus rendered to
Russia an immense service. They have maintained a certain
unity of the spoken language all over Russia, as also a unity
between the literary language and the language spoken by
the masses; between the music of Glínka, Tchaykóvsky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Rímsky Kórsakoff, Borodín, etc., and the music of the
peasant choir—thus rendering both the poet and the composer
accessible to the peasant.</p>

<h3>THE ANNALS</h3>

<p>And finally, whilst speaking of the early Russian literature,
a few words, at least, must be said of the Annals.</p>

<p>No country has a richer collection of them. There were,
in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries, several centres of
development in Russia, Kíeff, Nóvgorod, Pskov, the land of
Volhýnia, the land of Súzdal (Vladímir, Moscow<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>), Ryazán,
etc., represented at that time independent republics,
linked together only by the unity of language and religion,
and by the fact that all of them elected their Princes—military
defenders and judges—from the house of Rúrik. Each
of these centers had its own annals, bearing the stamp of
local life and local character. The South Russian and Volhýnian
annals—of which the so-called <i>Nestor’s Annals</i> are
the fullest and the best known, are not merely dry records of
facts: they are imaginative and poetical in places. The annals
of Nóvgorod bear the stamp of a city of rich merchants: they
are very matter-of-fact, and the annalist warms to his subject
only when he describes the victories of the Nóvgorod
republic over the Land of Súzdal. The Annals of the sister-republic
of Pskov, on the contrary, are imbued with a democratic
spirit, and they relate with democratic sympathies and
in a most picturesque manner the struggles between the poor
of Pskov and the rich—the “black people” and the “white
people.” Altogether, the annals are surely not the work of
monks, as was supposed at the outset; they must have been
written for the different cities by men fully informed about
their political life, their treaties with other republics, their
inner and outer conflicts.</p>

<p>Moreover, the annals, especially those of Kíeff, or <i>Nestor’s
Annals</i>, are something more than mere records of
events; they are, as may be seen from the very name of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
latter (<i>From whence and How came to be the Land of Russia</i>),
attempts at writing a history of the country, under the
inspiration of Greek models. Those manuscripts which have
reached us—and especially is this true of the Kíeff annals—have
thus a compound structure, and historians distinguish
in them several superposed “layers” dating from different
periods. Old traditions; fragments of early historical
knowledge, probably borrowed from the Byzantine historians;
old treaties; complete poems relating certain episodes,
such as Igor’s raid; and local annals from different periods,
enter into their composition. Historical facts, relative to a
very early period and fully confirmed by the Constantinople
annalists and historians, are consequently mingled together
with purely mythical traditions. But this is precisely what
makes the high literary value of the Russian annals,
especially those of Southern and South-western Russia, which
contain most precious fragments of early literature.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the treasuries of literature which Russia
possessed at the beginning of the thirteenth century.</p>

<h3>MEDIÆVAL LITERATURE</h3>

<p>The Mongol invasion, which took place in 1223, destroyed
all this young civilisation, and threw Russia into quite new
channels. The main cities of South and Middle Russia were
laid waste. Kíeff, which had been a populous city and a
centre of learning, was reduced to the state of a straggling
settlement, and disappeared from history for the next two
centuries. Whole populations of large towns were either
taken prisoners by the Mongols, or exterminated, if they
had offered resistance to the invaders. As if to add to the
misfortunes of Russia, the Turks soon followed the Mongols,
invading the Balkan peninsula, and by the end of the
fifteenth century the two countries from which and through
which learning used to come to Russia, namely Servia and
Bulgaria, fell under the rule of the Osmanlis. All the life of
Russia underwent a deep transformation.</p>

<p>Before the invasion the land was covered with independent
republics, similar to the mediæval city-republics of
Western Europe. Now, a military State, powerfully supported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by the Church, began to be slowly built up at Moscow,
which conquered, with the aid of the Mongol Khans, the independent
principalities that surrounded it. The main effort
of the statesmen and the most active men of the Church was
now directed towards the building up of a powerful kingdom
which should be capable of throwing off the Mongol yoke.
State ideals were substituted for those of local autonomy and
federation. The Church, in its effort to constitute a Christian
nationality, free from all intellectual and moral contact with
the abhorred pagan Mongols, became a stern centralised
power which pitilessly persecuted everything that was a reminder
of a pagan past. It worked hard, at the same time,
to establish upon Byzantine ideals the unlimited authority
of the Moscow princes. Serfdom was introduced in order to
increase the military power of the State. All Independent
local life was destroyed. The idea of Moscow becoming a
centre for Church and State was powerfully supported by the
Church, which preached that Moscow was the heir to Constantinople—“a
third Rome,” where the only true Christianity
was now to develop. And at a later epoch, when the
Mongol yoke had been thrown off, the work of consolidating
the Moscow monarchy was continued by the Tsars and
the Church, and the struggle was against the intrusion of
Western influences, in order to prevent the “Latin” Church
from extending its authority over Russia.</p>

<p>These new conditions necessarily exercised a deep influence
upon the further development of literature. The freshness
and vigorous youthfulness of the early epic poetry was gone
forever. Sadness, melancholy, resignation became the leading
features of Russian folk-lore. The continually repeated raids
of the Tartars, who carried away whole villages as prisoners
to their encampments in the South-eastern Steppes; the sufferings
of the prisoners in slavery; the visits of the <i>baskáks</i>,
who came to levy a high tribute and behaved as conquerors
in a conquered land; the hardships inflicted upon the populations
by the growing military State—all this impressed the
popular songs with a deep note of sadness which they have
never since lost. At the same time the gay festival songs of
old and the epic songs of the wandering bards were strictly
forbidden, and those who dared to sing them were cruelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
persecuted by the Church, which saw in these songs not only
a reminiscence of a pagan past, but also a possible link of
union with the Tartars.</p>

<p>Learning was gradually concentrated in the monasteries,
every one of which was a fortress built against the invaders;
and it was limited, of course, to Christian literature. It
became entirely scholastic. Knowledge of nature was “unholy,”
something of a witchcraft. Asceticism was preached
as the highest virtue, and became the dominant feature of
written literature. Legends about the saints were widely
read and repeated verbally, and they found no balance in
such learning as had been developed In Western Europe in
the mediæval universities. The desire for a knowledge of
nature was severely condemned by the Church, as a token
of self-conceit. All poetry was a sin. The annals lost their
animated character and became dry enumerations of the
successes of the rising State, or merely related unimportant
details concerning the local bishops and superiors of
monasteries.</p>

<p>During the twelfth century there had been, in the northern
republics of Nóvgorod and Pksov, a strong current of
opinion leading, on the one side, to Protestant rationalism,
and on the other side to the development of Christianity on
the lines of the early Christian brotherhoods. The apocryphal
Gospels, the books of the Old Testament, and various books
in which true Christianity was discussed, were eagerly copied
and had a wide circulation. Now, the head of the Church in
Central Russia violently antagonised all such tendencies
towards reformed Christianity. A strict adherence to the very
letter of the teachings of the Byzantine Church was exacted
from the flock. Every kind of interpretation of the Gospels
became heresy. All intellectual life in the domain of religion,
as well as every criticism of the dignitaries of the Moscow
Church, was treated as dangerous, and those who had ventured
this way had to flee from Moscow, seeking refuge
in the remote monasteries of the far North. As to the great
movement of the Renaissance, which gave a new life to
Western Europe, it did not reach Russia: the Church considered
it a return to paganism, and cruelly exterminated its
forerunners who came within her reach, burning them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
stake, or putting them to death on the racks of her torture-chambers.</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon this period, which covers nearly five
centuries, because it offers very little interest for the student
of Russian literature; I will only mention the two or three
works which must not be passed by in silence.</p>

<p>One of them is the letters exchanged between the Tsar
John the Terrible (John IV.), and one of his chief vassals,
Prince Kúrbskiy, who had left Moscow for Lithuania. From
beyond the Lithuanian border he addressed to his cruel, half-lunatic
ex-master long letters of reproach, which John answered,
developing in his epistles the theory of the divine
origin of the Tsar’s authority. This correspondence is most
characteristic of the political ideas that were current then,
and of the learning of the period.</p>

<p>After the death of John the Terrible (who occupies in
Russian history the same position as Louis XI. in French,
since he destroyed by fire and sword—but with a truly Tartar
cruelty—the power of the feudal princes), Russia passed, as
is known, through years of great disturbance. The pretender
Demetrius, who proclaimed himself a son of John, came
from Poland and took possession of the throne at Moscow.
The Poles invaded Russia, and were the masters of Moscow,
Smolénsk, and all the western towns; and when Demetrius
was overthrown, a few months after his coronation, a general
revolt of the peasants broke out, while all Central Russia was
invaded by Cossack bands, and several new pretenders made
their appearance. These “Disturbed Years” must have left
traces in popular songs, but all such songs entirely disappeared
in Russia during the dark period of serfdom which followed,
and we know of them only through an Englishman, <span class="smcap">Richard
James</span>, who was in Russia in 1619, and who wrote down some
of the songs relating to this period. The same must be said of
the folk-literature, which must have come into existence during
the later portion of the seventeenth century. The definite
introduction of serfdom under the first Romanoff (Mikhail,
1612-1640); the wide-spread revolts of the peasants which
followed—culminating in the terrific uprising of Stepán
Rázin, who has become since then a favourite hero with the
oppressed peasants; and finally the stern and cruel persecution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of the Non-conformists and their migrations eastward
into the depths of the Uráls—all these events must have
found their expression in folk-songs; but the State and the
Church so cruelly hunted down everything that bore trace
of a spirit of rebellion that no works of popular creation
from that period have reached us. Only a few writings of a
polemic character and the remarkable autobiography of an
exiled priest have been preserved by the Non-conformists.</p>

<h3>SPLIT IN THE CHURCH—MEMOIRS OF AVVAKÚM</h3>

<p>The first Russian Bible was printed in Poland in 1580. A
few years later a printing office was established at Moscow,
and the Russian Church authorities had now to decide which
of the written texts then in circulation should be taken for the
printing of the Holy Books. The handwritten copies which
were in use at that time were full of errors, and it was evidently
necessary to revise them by comparing them with the
Greek texts before committing any of them to print. This
revision was undertaken at Moscow, with the aid of learned
men brought over partly from Greece and partly from the
Greco-Latin Academy of Kieff; but for many different reasons
this revision became the source of a widely spread discontent,
and in the middle of the seventeenth century a formidable
split (<i>raskól</i>) took place in the Church. It hardly
need be said that this split was not a mere matter of theology,
nor of Greek readings. The seventeenth century was a century
when the Moscow Church had attained a formidable power
in the State. The head of it, the Patriarch Níkon, was,
moreover, a very ambitious man, who intended to play
in the East the part which the Pope played in the West, and
to that end he tried to impress the people by his grandeur
and luxury—which meant, of course, heavy impositions
upon the serfs of the Church and the lower clergy. He was
hated by both, and was soon accused by the people of drifting
into “Latinism”; so that the split between the people and
the clergy—especially the higher clergy—took the character
of a wide-spread separation of the people from the Greek
Church.</p>

<p>Most of the Non-conformist writings of the time are purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
scholastic in character and consequently offer no literary
interest. But the memoirs of a Non-conformist priest, <span class="smcap">Avvakúm</span>
(died 1681), who was exiled to Siberia and made
his way on foot, with Cossack parties, as far as the banks
of the Amúr, deserve to be mentioned. By their simplicity,
their sincerity, and absence of all sensationalism, they have
remained the prototype of Russian memoirs, down to the
present day. Here are a few quotations from this remarkable
work:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I came to Yeniséisk,” Avvakúm wrote, “another order
came from Moscow to send me to Daúria, 2,000 miles from Moscow,
and to place me under the orders of Páshkoff. He had with him sixty
men, and in punishment of my sins he proved to be a terrible man.
Continually he burnt, and tortured, and flogged his men, and I had
often spoken to him, remonstrating that what he did was not good,
and now I fell myself into his hands. When we went along the
Angará river he ordered me, ‘Get out of your boat, you are a heretic,
that is why the boats don’t get along. Go you on foot, across the
mountains.’ It was hard to do. Mountains high, forests impenetrable,
stony cliffs rising like walls—and we had to cross them, going about
with wild beasts and birds; and I wrote him a little letter which
began thus: ‘Man, be afraid of God. Even the heavenly forces and
all animals and men are afraid of Him. Thou alone carest nought
about Him.’ Much more was written in this letter, and I sent it
to him. Presently I saw fifty men coming to me, and they took me
before him. He had his sword in his hand and shook with fury.
He asked me: ‘Art thou a priest, or a priest degraded?’ I answered,
‘I am Avvakúm, a priest, what dost thou want from me?’ And he
began to beat me on the head and he threw me on the ground, and
continued to beat me while I was lying on the ground, and then
ordered them to give me seventy-two lashes with the knout, and
I replied: ‘Jesus Christ, son of God, help me!’ and he was only
the more angered that I did not ask for mercy. Then they brought
me to a small fort, and put me in a dungeon, giving me some straw,
and all the winter I was kept in that tower, without fire. And the
winter there is terribly cold; but God supported me, even though I
had no furs. I lay there as a dog on the straw. One day they would
feed me, another not. Rats were swarming all around. I used to kill
them with my cap—the poor fools would not even give me a stick.”</p>
</div>

<p>Later on Avvakúm was taken to the Amúr, and when he
and his wife had to march, in the winter, over the ice of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
great river, she would often fall down from sheer exhaustion.
“Then I came,” Avvakúm writes, “to lift her up,
and she exclaimed in despair: ‘How long, priest, how long
will these sufferings continue?’ And I replied to her: ‘Until
death even’; and then she would get up saying: ‘Well,
then, priest; let us march on.’” No sufferings could vanquish
this great man. From the Amúr he was recalled to
Moscow, and once more made the whole journey on foot.
There he was accused of resistance to Church and State, and
was burned at the stake in 1681.</p>

<h3>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>The violent reforms of Peter I., who created a military
European State out of the semi-Byzantine and semi-Tartar
State which Russia had been under his predecessors, gave a
new turn to literature. It would be out of place to appreciate
here the historical significance of the reforms of Peter I.,
but it must be mentioned that in Russian literature one finds,
at least, two forerunners of Peter’s work.</p>

<p>One of them was <span class="smcap">Kotoshíkhin</span> (1630-1667), an historian.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
He ran away from Moscow to Sweden, and wrote
there, fifty years before Peter became Tsar, a history of Russia,
in which he strenuously criticised the condition of ignorance
prevailing at Moscow, and advocated wide reforms.
His manuscript was unknown till the nineteenth century,
when it was discovered at Upsala. Another writer, imbued
with the same ideas, was a South Slavonian, <span class="smcap">Kryzhánitch</span>,
who was called to Moscow in 1659, in order to revise the
Holy Books, and wrote a most remarkable work, in which
he also preached the necessity of thorough reforms. He
was exiled two years later to Siberia, where he died.</p>

<p>Peter I., who fully realised the importance of literature,
and was working hard to introduce European learning
amongst his countrymen, understood that the old Slavonian
tongue, which was then in use among Russian writers, but
was no longer the current language of the nation, could only
hamper the development of literature and learning. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
forms, its expressions, and grammar were already quite
strange to the Russians. It could be used still in religious
writings, but a book on geometry, or algebra, or military
art, written in the Biblical Old Slavonian, would have been
simply ridiculous. Consequently, Peter removed the difficulty
in his usual trenchant way. He established a new
alphabet, to aid in the introduction into literature of the
spoken but hitherto unwritten language. This alphabet,
partly borrowed from the Old Slavonian, but very much
simplified, is the one now in use.</p>

<p>Literature proper little interested Peter I.: he looked upon
printed matter from the strictly utilitarian point of view,
and his chief aim was to familiarise the Russians with the
first elements of the exact sciences, as well as with the arts
of navigation, warfare, and fortification. Accordingly, the
writers of his time offer but little interest from the literary
point of view, and I need mention but a very few of
them.</p>

<p>The most interesting writer of the time of Peter I. and
his immediate successors was perhaps <span class="smcap">Procopóvitch</span>, a
priest, without the slightest taint of religious fanaticism,
a great admirer of West-European learning, who founded a
Greco-Slavonian academy. The courses of Russian literature
also make mention of <span class="smcap">Kantemir</span> (1709-1744), the son of
a Moldavian prince who had emigrated with his subjects to
Russia. He wrote satires, in which he expressed himself
with a freedom of thought that was quite remarkable for
his time.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <span class="smcap">Tkretiaóvskiy</span> (1703-1769) offers a certain
melancholy interest. He was the son of a priest, and in his
youth ran away from his father, in order to study at Moscow.
Thence he went to Amsterdam and Paris, travelling
mostly on foot. He studied at the Paris University and became
an admirer of advanced ideas, about which he wrote
in extremely clumsy verses. On his return to St. Petersburg
he lived all his after-life in poverty and neglect, persecuted on
all sides by sarcasms for his endeavours to reform Russian
versification. He was himself entirely devoid of any poetical
talent, and yet he rendered a great service to Russian poetry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Up to that date Russian verse was syllabic; but he understood
that syllabic verse does not accord with the spirit of
the Russian language, and he devoted his life to prove that
Russian poetry should be written according to the laws of
rhythmical versification. If he had had even a spark of
talent, he would have found no difficulty in proving his
thesis; but he had none, and consequently resorted to the
most ridiculous artifices. Some of his verses were lines of
the most incongruous words, strung together for the sole
purpose of showing how rhythm and rhymes may be
obtained. If he could not otherwise get his rhyme, he did not
hesitate to split a word at the end of a verse, beginning the
next one with what was left of it. In spite of his absurdities,
he succeeded in persuading Russian poets to adopt rhythmical
versification, and its rules have been followed ever since.
In fact, this was only the natural development of the Russian
popular song.</p>

<p>There was also a historian, <span class="smcap">Tatíscheff</span> (1686-1750),
who wrote a history of Russia, and began a large work
on the geography of the Empire—a hard-working man
who studied a great deal in many sciences, as well as
in Church matters, was superintendent of mines in the
Uráls, and wrote a number of political works as well
as history. He was the first to appreciate the value of
the annals, which he collected and systematised, thus preparing
materials for future historians, but he left no lasting
trace in Russian literature. In fact, only one man of
that period deserves more than a passing mention. It was
<span class="smcap">Lomonósoff</span> (1712-1765). He was born in a village
on the White Sea, near Archángel, in a fisherman’s family.
He also ran away from his parents, came on foot to Moscow,
and entered a school in a monastery, living there in
indescribable poverty. Later on he went to Kíeff, also on
foot, and there he very nearly became a priest. It so happened,
however, that at that time the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences applied to the Moscow Theological
Academy for twelve good students who might be sent to
study abroad. Lomonósoff was chosen as one of them. He
went to Germany, where he studied natural sciences under
the best natural philosophers of the time, especially under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Christian Wolff,—always in terrible poverty, almost on the
verge of starvation. In 1741 he came back to Russia, and
was nominated a member of the Academy of Sciences at St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>The Academy was then in the hands of a few Germans
who looked upon all Russian scholars with undisguised contempt,
and consequently received Lomonósoff in a most
unfriendly manner. It did not help him that the great mathematician,
Euler, wrote that the work of Lomonósoff in
natural philosophy and chemistry revealed a man of genius,
and that any Academy might be happy to possess him. A
bitter struggle soon began between the German members
of the Academy and the Russian who, it must be owned,
was of a very violent character, especially when he was
under the influence of drink. Poverty, his salary being confiscated
as a punishment; detention at the police station;
exclusion from the Senate of the Academy; and, worst of
all, political persecution—such was the fate of Lomonósoff,
who had joined the party of Elizabeth, and consequently
was treated as an enemy when Catharine II. came to the
throne. It was not until the nineteenth century that Lomonósoff
was duly appreciated.</p>

<p>“Lomonósoff was himself a university,” was Púshkin’s
remark, and this remark was quite correct: so varied were
the directions in which he worked. Not only was he a distinguished
natural philosopher, chemist, physical geographer,
and mineralogist: he laid also the foundations of the grammar
of the Russian language, which he understood as part
of a general grammar of all languages, considered in their
natural evolution. He also worked out the different forms
of Russian versification, and he created quite a new literary
language, of which he could say that it was equally appropriate
for rendering “the powerful oratory of Cicero, the
brilliant earnestness of Virgil and the pleasant talk of Ovid,
as well as the subtlest imaginary conceptions of philosophy,
or discussing the various properties of matter and the
changes which are always going on in the structure of the
universe and in human affairs.” This he proved by his
poetry, by his scientific writings, and by his “Discourses,” in
which he combined Huxley’s readiness to defend science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
against blind faith with Humboldt’s poetical conception of
Nature.</p>

<p>His odes were, it is true, written in the pompous style which
was dear to the pseudo-classicism then reigning, and he
retained Old Slavonian expressions “for dealing with elevated
subjects”, but in his scientific and other writings he
used the commonly spoken language with great effect and
force. Owing to the very variety of sciences which he had
to acclimatise in Russia, he could not give much time to
original research; but when he took up the defence of the
ideas of Copernicus, Newton, or Huyghens against the
opposition which they met with on theological grounds, a
true philosopher of natural science, in the modern sense of
the term, was revealed in him. In his early boyhood he used
to accompany his father—a sturdy northern fisherman—on
his fishing expeditions, and there he got his love of
Nature and a fine comprehension of natural phenomena,
which made of his Memoir on Arctic Exploration a work
that has not lost its value even now. It is well worthy of
note that in this last work he had stated the mechanical
theory of heat in such definite expressions that he undoubtedly
anticipated by a full century this great discovery
of our own time—a fact which has been entirely overlooked,
even in Russia.</p>

<p>A contemporary of Lomonósoff, <span class="smcap">Sumarókoff</span> (1717-1777,)
who was described in those years as a “Russian
Racine,” must also be mentioned in this place. He belonged
to the higher nobility, and had received an entirely French
education. His dramas, of which he wrote a great number,
were entirely imitated from the French pseudo-classical
school; but he contributed very much, as will be seen from
a subsequent chapter, to the development of the Russian
theatre. Sumarókoff wrote also lyrical verses, elegies, and
satires—all of no great importance; but the remarkably good
style of his letters, free of the Slavonic archaisms, which were
habitual at that time, deserves to be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<h3>THE TIMES OF CATHERINE II.</h3>

<p>With Catherine II., who reigned from 1752 till 1796,
commenced a new era in Russian literature. It began to
shake off its previous dulness, and although the Russian
writers continued to imitate French models—chiefly pseudo-classical—they
began also to introduce into their writings
various subjects taken from direct observation of Russian
life. There is, altogether, a frivolous youthfulness in the
literature of the first years of Catherine’s reign, when the
Empress, being yet full of progressive ideas borrowed from
her intercourse with French philosophers, composed—basing
it on Montesquieu—her remarkable <i>Instruction</i>
(<i>Nakáz</i>) to the deputies she convoked; wrote several comedies,
in which she ridiculed the old-fashioned representatives
of Russian nobility; and edited a monthly review in
which she entered into controversy both with some ultra-conservative
writers and with the more advanced young
reformers. An academy of belles-lettres was founded, and
Princess <span class="smcap">Vorontsóva-Dáshkova</span> (1743-1819)—who had
aided Catherine II. in her <i>coup d’état</i> against her husband,
Peter III., and in taking possession of the throne—was
nominated president of the Academy of Sciences. She
assisted the Academy with real earnestness in compiling a
dictionary of the Russian language, and she also edited a
review which left a mark in Russian literature; while her
memoirs, written in French (<i>Mon Histoire</i>) are a very valuable,
though not always impartial, historical document.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Altogether there began at that time quite a literary movement,
which produced a remarkable poet, <span class="smcap">Derzhávin</span>
(1743-1816); the writer of comedies, <span class="smcap">Von Wízin</span> (1745-1792);
the first philosopher, <span class="smcap">Nóvikoff</span> (1742-1818); and
a political writer, <span class="smcap">Radíschfef</span>(1749-1802).</p>

<p>The poetry of Derzhávin certainly does not answer our
modern requirements. He was the poet laureate of Catherine,
and sang in pompous odes the virtues of the ruler and
the victories of her generals and favourites. Russia was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
then taking a firm hold on the shores of the Black Sea, and
beginning to play a serious part in European affairs; and
occasions for the inflation of Derzhávin’s patriotic feelings
were not wanting. However, he had some of the marks
of the true poet; he was open to the feeling of the poetry
of Nature, and capable of expressing it in verses that were
positively good (<i>Ode to God</i>, <i>The Waterfall</i>). Nay, these
really poetical verses, which are found side by side with
unnatural, heavy lines stuffed with obsolete pompous words,
are so evidently better than the latter, that they certainly
were an admirable object-lesson for all subsequent Russian
poets. They must have contributed to induce our poets to
abandon mannerism. Púshkin, who in his youth admired
Derzhávin, must have felt at once the disadvantages of a
pompous style, illustrated by his predecessor, and with his
wonderful command of his mother-tongue he was necessarily
brought to abandon the artificial language which formerly
was considered “poetical,”—he began to write as we speak.</p>

<p>The comedies of <span class="smcap">Von Wízin</span> (or <span class="smcap">Fonvizin</span>), were
quite a revelation for his contemporaries. His first comedy,
<i>The Brigadier</i>, which he wrote at the age of twenty-two,
created quite a sensation, and till now it has not lost its
interest; while his second comedy, <i>Nédorosl</i> (1782), was
received as an event in Russian literature, and is occasionally
played even at the present day. Both deal with
purely Russian subjects, taken from every-day life; and
although Von Wízin too freely borrowed from foreign
authors (the subject of <i>The Brigadier</i> is borrowed from a
Danish comedy of Holberg, <i>Jean de France</i>), he managed
nevertheless to make his chief personages truly Russian. In
this sense he certainly was a creator of the Russian national
drama, and he was also the first to introduce into our literature
the realistic tendency which became so powerful with
Púshkin, Gógol and their followers. In his political opinions
he remained true to the progressive opinions which Catherine
II. patronised in the first years of her reign, and in his
capacity of secretary to Count Pánin he boldly denounced
serfdom, favouritism, and want of education in Russia.</p>

<p>I pass in silence several writers of the same epoch, namely,
<span class="smcap">Bogdanóvitch</span> (1743-1803), the author of a pretty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
light poem, <i>Dushenka</i>; <span class="smcap">Hemnitzer</span> (1745-1784), a gifted
writer of fables, who was a forerunner of Krylóff; <span class="smcap">Kapníst</span>
(1757-1829), who wrote rather superficial satires in good
verse; Prince <span class="smcap">Scherbátoff</span> (1733-1790), who began with
several others the scientific collecting of old annals and folk-lore,
and undertook to write a history of Russia, in which we
find a scientific criticism of the annals and other sources of
information; and several others. But I must say a few words
upon the masonic movement which took place on the
threshold of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>THE FREEMASONS: FIRST MANIFESTATION OF POLITICAL
THOUGHT.</h3>

<p>The looseness of habits which characterised Russian high
society in the eighteenth century, the absence of ideals, the
servility of the nobles, and the horrors of serfdom, necessarily
produced a reaction amongst the better minds, and
this reaction took the shape, partly of a widely spread
Masonic movement, and partly of Christian mysticism, which
originated in the mystical teachings that had at that time
widely spread in Germany. The freemasons and their
Society of Friends undertook a serious effort for spreading
moral education among the masses, and they found in
<span class="smcap">Nóvikoff</span> (1744-1818) a true apostle of renovation. He
began his literary career very early, in one of those satirical
reviews of which Catherine herself took the initiative at
the beginning of her reign, and already in his amiable controversy
with “the grandmother” (Catherine) he showed
that he would not remain satisfied with the superficial satire
in which the empress delighted, but that, contrary to her
wishes, he would go to the root of the evils of the time:
namely, serfdom and its brutalising effects upon society at
large. Nóvikoff was not only a well-educated man: he combined
the deep moral convictions of an idealist with the
capacities of an organiser and a business man; and although
his review (from which the net income went entirely for
philanthropic and educational purposes) was soon stopped
by “the grandmother,” he started in Moscow a most successful
printing and book-selling business, for editing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
spreading books of an ethical character. His immense printing
office, combined with a hospital for the workers and a
chemist’s shop, from which medicine was given free to all
the poor of Moscow, was soon in business relations with
booksellers all over Russia; while his influence upon educated
society was growing rapidly, and working in an excellent
direction. In 1787, during a famine, he organised relief
for the starving peasants—quite a fortune having been put
for this purpose at his disposal by one of his pupils. Of
course, both the Church and the Government looked with
suspicion upon the spreading of Christianity, as it was understood
by the freemason Friends; and although the metropolitan
of Moscow testified that Nóvikoff was “the best
Christian he ever knew,” Nóvikoff was accused of political
conspiracy.</p>

<p>He was arrested, and in accordance with the personal
wish of Catherine, though to the astonishment of all
those who knew anything about him, was condemned to
death in 1792. The death-sentence, however, was not fulfilled,
but he was taken for fifteen years to the terrible
fortress of Schüsselberg, where he was put in the secret cell
formerly occupied by the Grand Duke Ivan Antonovitch, and
where his freemason friend, Doctor Bagryánskiy, volunteered
to remain imprisoned with him. He remained there
till the death of Catherine. Paul I. released him, in 1796,
on the very day that he became emperor; but Nóvikoff came
out of the fortress a broken man, and fell entirely into
mysticism, towards which there was already a marked tendency
in several lodges of the freemasons.</p>

<p>The Christian mystics were not happier. One of them,
<span class="smcap">Lábzin</span> (1766-1825), who exercised a great influence upon
society by his writings against corruption, was also denounced,
and ended his days in exile. However, both the
mystical Christians and the freemasons (some of whose
lodges followed the Rosenkreuz teachings) exercised a deep
influence on Russia. With the advent of Alexander I. to the
throne the freemasons obtained more facilities for spreading
their ideas; and the growing conviction that serfdom must
be abolished, and that the tribunals, as well as the whole
system of administration, were in need of complete reform,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
was certainly to a great extent a result of their work. Besides,
quite a number of remarkable men received their education
at the Moscow Institute of the Friends—founded by
Nóvikoff—including the historian Karamzín, the brothers
Turguéneff, uncles of the great novelist, and several political
men of mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Radíscheff</span> (1749-1802), a political writer of the
same epoch, had a still more tragic end. He received his
education in the Corps of Pages, and was one of those young
men whom the Russian Government had sent in 1766 to
Germany to finish there their education. He followed the
lectures of Hellert and Plattner at Leipzig, and studied very
earnestly the French philosophers. On his return, he published,
in 1790, a <i>Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</i>,
the idea of which seems to have been suggested to him by
Sterne’s <i>Sentimental Journey</i>. In this book he very ably intermingled
his impressions of travel with various philosophical
and moral discussions and with pictures from Russian
life.</p>

<p>He insisted especially upon the horrors of serfdom, as also
upon the bad organisation of the administration, the venality
of the law-courts, and so on, confirming his general
condemnations by concrete facts taken from real life. Catherine,
who already before the beginning of the revolution in
France, and especially since the events of 1789, had come to
regard with horror the liberal ideas of her youth, ordered
the book to be confiscated and destroyed at once. She
described the author as a revolutionist, “worse than Pugatchóff”;
he ventured to “speak with approbation of Franklin”
and was infected with French ideas! Consequently, she wrote
herself a sharp criticism of the book, upon which its prosecution
had to be based. Radíscheff was arrested, confined to
the fortress, later on transported to the remotest portions
of Eastern Siberia, on the Olenek. He was released only in
1801. Next year, seeing that even the advent of Alexander the
First did not mean the coming of a new reformatory spirit,
he put an end to his life by suicide. As to his book, it still
remains forbidden in Russia. A new edition of it, which was
made in 1872, was confiscated and destroyed, and in 1888
the permission was given to a publisher to issue the work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
editions of a hundred copies only, which were to be distributed
among a few men of science and certain high functionaries.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3>THE FIRST YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

<p>These were, then, the elements out of which Russian
literature had to be evolved in the nineteenth century. The
slow work of the last five hundred years had already prepared
that admirable, pliable, and rich instrument—the literary
language in which Púshkin would soon be enabled to
write his melodious verses and Turguéneff his no less
melodious prose. From the autobiography of the Non-conformist
martyr, Avvakúm, one could already guess the value
of the spoken language of the Russian people for literary
purposes.</p>

<p>Tretiakóvskiy, by his clumsy verses, and especially Lomonósoff
and Derzhávin by their odes, had definitely repelled
the syllabic form that had been introduced from France
and Poland, and had established the tonic, rhythmical
form which was indicated by the popular song itself.
Lomonósoff had created a popular scientific language; he
had invented a number of new words, and had proved that
the Latin and Old Slavonian constructions were hostile to
the spirit of Russian, and quite unnecessary. The age of Catherine
II. further introduced into written literature the forms
of familiar everyday talk, borrowed even from the peasant
class; and Nóvikoff had created a Russian philosophical
language—still heavy on account of its underlying mysticism,
but splendidly adapted, as it appeared a few decades
later, to abstract metaphysical discussions. The elements for
a great and original literature were thus ready. They required
only a vivifying spirit which should use them for
higher purposes. This genius was Púshkin. But before speaking
of him, the historian and novelist Karamzín and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
poet Zhukóvskiy<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> must be mentioned, as they represent a
link between the two epochs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karamzín</span> (1766-1826), by his monumental work, <i>The
History of the Russian State</i>, did in literature what the great
war of 1812 had done in national life. He awakened the
national consciousness and created a lasting interest in the
history of the nation, in the making of the empire, in the
evolution of national character and institutions. Karamzín’s
<i>History</i> was reactionary in spirit. He was the historian
of the Russian State, not of the Russian people; the poet
of the virtues of monarchy and the wisdom of the rulers, but
not an observer of the work that had been accomplished by
the unknown masses of the nation. He was not the man to
understand the federal principles which prevailed in Russia
down to the fifteenth century, and still less the communal
principles which pervaded Russian life and had permitted the
nation to conquer and to colonise an immense continent. For
him, the history of Russia was the regular, organic development
of a monarchy, from the first appearance of the
Scandinavian <i>varingiar</i> down to the present times, and he
was chiefly concerned with describing the deeds of monarchs
in their conquests and their building up of a State; but, as
it often happens with Russian writers, his foot-notes were a
work of history in themselves. They contained a rich mine of
information concerning the sources of Russia’s history, and
they suggested to the ordinary reader that the early centuries
of mediæval Russia, with her independent city-republics,
were far more interesting than they appeared in the book.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Karamzín was not the founder of a school, but he showed
to Russia that she has a past worth knowing. Besides, his
work was a work of art. It was written in a brilliant style,
which accustomed the public to read historical works. The
result was, that the first edition of his eight-volume <i>History</i>—3,000
copies—was sold in twenty-five days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>However, Karamzín’s influence was not limited to his
<i>History</i>: it was even greater through his novels and his
<i>Letters of a Russian Traveller Abroad</i>. In the latter he
made an attempt to bring the products of European thought,
philosophy, and political life into circulation amidst a wide
public; to spread broadly humanitarian views, at a time when
they were most needed as a counterpoise to the sad realities
of political and social life; and to establish a link of connection
between the intellectual life of our country and that of
Europe. As to Karamzín’s novels, he appeared in them as a
true follower of sentimental romanticism; but this was precisely
what was required then, as a reaction against the
would-be classical school. In one of his novels, <i>Poor Liza</i>
(1792), he described the misfortunes of a peasant girl who
fell in love with a nobleman, was abandoned by him, and
finally drowned herself in a pond. This peasant girl surely
would not answer to our present realistic requirements. She
spoke in choice language and was not a peasant girl at all;
but all reading Russia cried about the misfortune of “poor
Liza,” and the pond where the heroine was supposed to have
been drowned became a place of pilgrimage for the sentimental
youths of Moscow. The spirited protest against
serfdom which we shall find later on in modern literature
was thus already born in Karamzín’s time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zhukóvskiy</span> (1783-1852) was a romantic poet in the
true sense of the word, and a true worshipper of poetry, who
fully understood its elevating power. His original productions
were few. He was mainly a translator and rendered in
most beautiful Russian verses the poems of Schiller, Uhland,
Herder, Byron, Thomas Moore, and others, as well as the
Odyssey, the Hindu poem of Nal and Ramayanti, and the
songs of the Western Slavonians. The beauty of these translations
is such that I doubt whether there are in any other
language, even in German, equally beautiful renderings of
foreign poets. However, Zhukóvskiy was not a mere translator:
he took from other poets only what was agreeable to
his own nature and what he would have liked to sing himself.
Sad reflections about the unknown, an aspiration towards distant
lands, the sufferings of love, and the sadness of
separation—all lived through by the poet—were the distinctive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
features of his poetry. They reflected his inner self.
We may object now to his ultra-romanticism, but this direction,
at that time, was an appeal to the broadly humanitarian
feelings, and it was of first necessity for progress. By his
poetry, Zhukóvskiy appealed chiefly to women, and when we
deal later on with the part that Russian women played half
a century later in the general development of their country,
we shall see that his appeal was not made in vain. Altogether,
Zhukóvskiy appealed to the best sides of human nature. One
note, however, was missing entirely in his poetry: it was the
appeal to the sentiments of freedom and citizenship. This
appeal came from the “Decembrist” poet, Ryléeff.</p>

<h3>THE “DECEMBRISTS”</h3>

<p>The Tsar Alexander I. went through the same evolution as
his grandmother, Catherine II. He was educated by the
republican, La Harpe, and began his reign as a quite liberal
sovereign, ready to grant to Russia a constitution. He did
it in fact for Poland and Finland, and made a first step
towards it in Russia. But he did not dare to touch serfdom,
and gradually he fell under the influence of German mystics,
became alarmed at liberal ideas, and surrendered his will to
the worst reactionaries. The man who ruled Russia during
the last ten or twelve years of his reign was General
Arakchéeff—a maniac of cruelty and militarism, who maintained
his influence by means of the crudest flattery and
simulated religiousness.</p>

<p>A reaction against these conditions was sure to grow up,
the more so as the Napoleonic wars had brought a great
number of Russians in contact with Western Europe. The
campaigns made in Germany, and the occupation of Paris by
the Russian armies, had familiarised many officers with the
ideas of liberty which reigned still in the French capital,
while at home the endeavours of Nóvikoff were bearing
fruit, and the freemason Friends continued his work. When
Alexander I., having fallen under the influence of Madame
Krüdener and other German mystics, concluded in 1815 the
Holy Alliance with Germany and Austria, in order to combat
all liberal ideas, secret societies began to be formed in Russia—chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
among the officers—in order to promote the ideas
of liberty, of abolition of serfdom, and of equality before the
law, as the necessary steps towards the abolition of absolute
rule. Everyone who has read Tolstóy’s <i>War and Peace</i> must
remember “Pierre” and the impression produced upon this
young man by his first meeting with an old freemason.
“Pierre” is a true representative of many young men who
later on became known as “Decembrists.” Like “Pierre,”
they were imbued with humanitarian ideas; many of them
hated serfdom, and they wanted the introduction of constitutional
guarantees; while a few of them (Péstel, Ryléef),
despairing of monarchy, spoke of a return to the republican
federalism of old Russia. With such ends in view, they
created their secret societies.</p>

<p>It is known how this conspiracy ended. After the sudden
death of Alexander I. in the South of Russia, the oath of
allegiance was given at St. Petersburg to his brother Constantine,
who was proclaimed his successor. But when, a
few days later, it became known in the capital that Constantine
had abdicated, and that his brother Nicholas was going
to become emperor, and when the conspirators learned that
they had been denounced in the meantime to the State police,
they saw nothing else to do but to proclaim their programme
openly in the streets, and to fall in an unequal fight. They did
so, on December 14 (26), 1825, in the Senate Square of St.
Petersburg, followed by a few hundred men from several
regiments of the guard. Five of the insurgents were hanged
by Nicholas I., and the remainder, <i>i. e.</i>, about a hundred
young men who represented the flower of Russian intelligence,
were sent to hard labour in Siberia, where they remained till
1856. One can hardly imagine what it meant, in a country
which was not over-rich in educated and well-intentioned
men, when such a number of the best representatives of a
generation were taken out of the ranks and reduced to
silence. Even in a more civilised country of Western Europe
the sudden disappearance of so many men of thought and
action would have dealt a severe blow to progress. In
Russia the effect was disastrous—the more so as the reign
of Nicholas I. lasted thirty years, during which every spark
of free thought was stifled as soon as it appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>One of the most brilliant literary representatives of the
“Decembrists” was <span class="smcap">Ryléef</span> (1795-1826), one of the five
who were hanged by Nicholas I. He had received a good
education, and in 1814 was already an officer. He was thus
by a few years the elder of Púshkin. He twice visited France,
in 1814 and 1815, and after the conclusion of peace became
a magistrate at St. Petersburg. His earlier productions were
a series of ballads dealing with the leading men of Russian
history. Most of them were merely patriotic, but some already
revealed the sympathies of the poet for freedom.
Censorship did not allow these ballads to be printed, but
they circulated all over Russia in manuscript. Their poetical
value was not great; but the next poem of Ryléef, <i>Voinaróvsky</i>,
and especially some fragments of unfinished poems,
revealed in him a powerful poetical gift, which Ryléef’s
great friend, Púshkin, greeted with effusion. It is greatly to
be regretted that the poem <i>Voinaróvsky</i> has never been
translated into English. Its subject is the struggle of Little
Russia for the recovery of its independence under Peter I.
When the Russian Tsar was engaged in a bitter struggle
against the great northern warrior, Charles XII., then the
ruler of Little Russia, the <i>hétman</i> Mazépa conceived the
plan of joining Charles XII. against Peter I. for freeing his
mother country from the Russian yoke. Charles XII., as is
known, was defeated at Poltáva, and both he and the <i>hétman</i>
had to flee to Turkey. As to Voinaróvsky, a young patriot
friend of Mazépa, he was taken prisoner, and transported
to Siberia. There, at Yakútsk, he was visited by the historian
Müller, and Ryléeff makes him tell his story to the German
explorer. The scenes of nature in Siberia, at Yakútsk, with
which the poem begins; the preparations for the war in Little
Russia and the war itself; the flight of Charles XII. and
Mazépa; then the sufferings of Voinaróvsky at Yakútsk,
when his young wife came to rejoin him in the land of
exile, and died there—all these scenes are most beautiful,
while in places the verses, by their simplicity and the beauty
of their images, evoked the admiration even of Púshkin.
Two or three generations have now read this poem, and
it continues to inspire each new one with the same love of
liberty and hatred of oppression.</p>

<h3>PÚSHKIN</h3>

<p>Púshkin is not quite a stranger to English readers.
In a valuable collection of review articles dealing with
Russian writers which Professor Coolidge, of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, put at my disposal, I found that
in 1832, and later on in 1845, Púshkin was spoken of as a
writer more or less familiar in England, and translations of
some of his lyrics were given in the reviews. Later on Púshkin
was rather neglected in Russia itself, and the more so
abroad, and up to the present time there is no English translation,
worthy of the great poet, of any of his works. In
France, on the contrary—owing to Turguéneff and Prosper
Mérimée, who saw in Púshkin one of the great poets of mankind—as
well as in Germany, all the chief works of the
Russian poet are known to literary men in good translations,
of which some are admirable. To the great reading
public the Russian poet is, however, nowhere well known
outside his own mother country.</p>

<p>The reason why Púshkin has not become a favourite with
West European readers is easily understood. His lyric verse
is certainly inimitable: it is that of a great poet. His chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
novel in verse, <i>Evghéniy Onyéghin</i>, is written with an easiness
and a lightness of style, and a picturesqueness of detail,
which makes it stand unique in European literature. His
renderings in verses of Russian popular tales are delightful
reading. But, apart from his very latest productions in the
dramatic style, there is in whatever Púshkin wrote none of
the depth and elevation of ideas which characterised Goethe
and Schiller, Shelley, Byron, and Browning, Victor Hugo
and Barbier. The beauty of form, the happy ways of expression,
the incomparable command of verse and rhyme,
are his main points—not the beauty of his <i>ideas</i>. And what
we look for in poetry is always the higher inspiration, the
noble ideas which can help to make us better. In reading
Púshkin’s verses the Russian reader is continually brought
to exclaim: “How beautifully this has been told! It could
not, it ought not, to be told in a different way.” In this beauty
of form Púshkin is inferior to none of the greatest poets.
In his ways of expressing even the most insignificant remarks,
and describing the most insignificant details of everyday life;
in the variety of human feeling that he has expressed, and
the delicate expression of love under a variety of aspects
which is contained in his poetry; and finally, in the way he
deeply impressed his own personality upon everything he
wrote—he is certainly a great poet.</p>

<p>It is extremely interesting to compare Púshkin with Schiller,
in their lyrics. Leaving aside the greatness and the
variety of subjects touched upon by Schiller, and comparing
only those pieces of poetry in which both poets speak of
themselves, one feels at once that Schiller’s personality is
infinitely superior, in depth of thought and philosophical
comprehension of life, to that of the bright, somewhat spoiled
and rather superficial child that Púshkin was. But, at the
same time, the individuality of Púshkin is more deeply impressed
upon his writings than that of Schiller upon his.
Púshkin was full of vital intensity, and his own self is reflected
in everything he wrote; a human heart, full of fire,
is throbbing intensely in all his verses. This heart is far less
sympathetic than that of Schiller, but it is more intimately
revealed to the reader. In his best lyrics Schiller did not
find either a better expression of feeling, or a greater variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of expression, than Púshkin did. In that respect the Russian
poet decidedly stands by the side of Goethe.</p>

<p>Púshkin was born in an aristocratic family at Moscow.
Through his mother he had African blood in his veins: she
was a beautiful creole, the granddaughter of a negro who
had been in the service of Peter I. His father was a typical
representative of the noblemen of those times: squandering
a large fortune, living all his life anyhow and anyway,
amidst feasts, in a house half-furnished and half-empty;
fond of the lighter French literature of the time, fond of
entering into a discussion upon anything that he had just
learned from the encyclopædists, and bringing together at
his house all possible notabilities of literature, Russian and
French, who happened to be at Moscow.</p>

<p>Púshkin’s grandmother and his old nurse were the future
poet’s best friends in his childhood. From them he got his
perfect mastership of the Russian language; and from his
nurse, with whom he used to spend, later on, the long
winter nights at his country house, when he was ordered by
the State police to reside on his country estate, he borrowed
that admirable knowledge of Russian folk-lore and Russian
ways of expression which rendered his poetry and prose so
wonderfully Russian. To these two women we thus owe the
creation of the modern, easy, pliable Russian language which
Púshkin introduced into our literature.</p>

<p>He was educated at St. Petersburg, at the Tsárskoe Seló
Lyceum, and even before he left school he became renowned
as a most extraordinary poet, in whom Derzhávin recognised
more than a mere successor, and whom Zhukóvskiy presented
was his portrait bearing the following inscription: “To a
pupil, from his defeated teacher.” Unfortunately, Púshkin’s
passionate nature drew him away from both the literary
circles and the circles of his best friends—the Decembrists
Púschin and Küchelbecker—into the circles of the lazy, insignificant
aristocrats, amongst whom he spent his vital
energy in orgies. Something of the shallow, empty sort of
life he lived then he has himself described in <i>Evghéniy
Onyéghin</i>.</p>

<p>Being friendly with the political youth who appeared six
or seven years later, on the square of Peter I. at St. Petersburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
as insurgents against autocracy and serfdom, Púshkin
wrote an <i>Ode to Liberty</i>, and numbers of small pieces of
poetry expressing the most revolutionary ideas, as well as
satires against the rulers of the time. The result was that in
1820, when he was only twenty years old, he was exiled to
Kishinyóff, a very small town at that time, in newly annexed
Bessarabia, where he led the most extravagant life, eventually
joining a party of wandering gypsies. Happily enough
he was permitted to leave for some time this dusty and uninteresting
little spot, and to make, in company with the
charming and educated family of the Rayévskys, a journey
to the Crimea and the Caucasus, from which journey he
brought back some of his finest lyrical works.</p>

<p>In 1824, when he had rendered himself quite impossible
at Odessa (perhaps also from fear that he might escape to
Greece, to join Byron), he was ordered to return to Central
Russia and to reside at his small estate, Mikhaílovskoye, in
the province of Pskov, where he wrote his best things. On
December 14, 1825, when the insurrection broke out at St.
Petersburg, Púshkin was at Mikhaílovskoye; otherwise, like
so many of his Decembrist friends, he would most certainly
have ended his life in Siberia. He succeeded in burning all
his papers before they could be seized by the secret police.</p>

<p>Shortly after that he was allowed to return to St. Petersburg:
Nicholas I. undertaking to be himself the censor of
his verses, and later on making Púshkin a chamberlain of his
Court. Poor Púshkin had thus to live the futile life of a
small functionary of the Winter Palace, and this life he
certainly hated. The Court nobility and bureaucracy could
never pardon him that he, who did not belong to their circle,
was considered such a great man in Russia, and Púshkin’s
life was full of little stings to his self-respect, coming from
these classes. He had also the misfortune to marry a lady who
was very beautiful but did not in the least appreciate his
genius. In 1837 he had to fight on her account a duel, in
which he was killed, at the age of thirty-five.</p>

<p>One of his earliest productions, written almost immediately
after he left school, was <i>Ruslán and Ludmíla</i>, a fairy
tale, which he put into beautiful verse. The dominating element
of this poem is that wonderland where “a green oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
stands on the sea-beach, and a learned cat goes round the
oak,—to which it is attached by a golden chain,—singing
songs when it goes to the left, and telling tales when it goes
to the right.” It is the wedding day of Ludmíla, the heroine;
the long bridal feast comes at last to an end, and she retires
with her husband; when all of a sudden comes darkness,
thunder resounds, and in the storm Ludmíla disappears. She
has been carried away by the terrible sorcerer from the Black
Sea—a folk-lore allusion, of course, to the frequent raids of
the nomads of Southern Russia. Now, the unhappy husband,
as also three other young men, who were formerly suitors of
Ludmíla, saddle their horses and go in search of the vanished
bride. From their experiences the tale is made up, and it is
full of both touching passages and very humorous episodes.
After many adventures, Ruslán recovers his Ludmíla, and
everything ends to the general satisfaction, as folk-tales
always do.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This was a most youthful production of Púshkin, but its
effect in Russia was tremendous. Classicism, <i>i. e</i>. the pseudo-classicism
which reigned then, was defeated for ever. Everyone
wanted to have the poem, everyone retained in memory
whole passages and even pages from it, and with this tale the
modern Russian literature—simple, realistic in its descriptions,
modest in its images and fable, earnest and slightly
humouristic—was created. In fact, one could not imagine a
greater simplicity in verse than that which Púshkin had
already obtained in this poem. But to give an idea of this simplicity
to English readers remains absolutely impossible so
long as the poem is not translated by some very gifted English
poet. Suffice it to say that, while its verses are wonderfully
musical, it contains not one single passage in which the author
has resorted to unusual or obsolete words—to any words,
indeed, but those which everyone uses in common conversation.</p>

<p>Thunders came upon Púshkin from the classical camp
when this poem made its appearance. We have only to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
of the Daphnes and the Chloes with which poetry used to be
embellished at that time, and the sacerdotal attitude which
the poet took towards his readers, to understand how
the classical school was offended at the appearance of a poet
who expressed his thoughts in beautiful images, without
resorting to any of these embellishments, who spoke the
language which everyone speaks, and related adventures fit
for the nursery. With one cut of his sword Púshkin had freed
literature from the ties which were keeping it enslaved.</p>

<p>The tales which he had heard from his old nurse gave him
the matter, not only for <i>Ruslán and Ludmíla</i>, but also for
a series of popular tales, of which the verses are so natural
that as soon as you have pronounced one word that word
calls up immediately the next, and this the following, because
you cannot say the thing otherwise than in the way in
which Púshkin has told it. “Is it not exactly so that tales
should be told?” was asked all over Russia; and, the reply
being in the affirmative, the fight against pseudo-classicism
was won forever.</p>

<p>This simplicity of expression characterised Púshkin in
everything he afterwards wrote. He did not depart from it,
even when he wrote about so-called elevated subjects, nor in
the passionate or philosophical monologues of his latest
dramas. It is what makes Púshkin so difficult to translate
into English; because, in the English literature of the nineteenth
century, Wordsworth is the only poet who has written
with the same simplicity. But, while Wordsworth applied this
simplicity mainly to the description of the lovely and quiet
English landscape, Púshkin spoke with the same simplicity
of human life, and his verses continued to flow, as easy as
prose and as free from artificial expressions, even when he
described the most violent human passions. In his contempt
of everything exaggerated and theatrical, and in his determination
to have nothing to do with “the lurid tragic actor
who wields a cardboard sword,” he was thoroughly Russian:
and at the same time he powerfully contributed towards
establishing, in both the written literature and on the stage,
that taste for simplicity and honest expression of feeling of
which so many examples will be given in the course of this
book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>The main force of Púshkin was in his lyric poetry, and the
chief note of his lyrics was love. The terrible contradictions
between the ideal and the real, from which deeper minds,
like those of Goethe, or Byron, or Heine, have suffered, were
strange to him. Púshkin was of a more superficial nature. It
must also be said that a West-European poet has an inheritance
which the Russian has not. Every country of Western
Europe has passed through periods of great national
struggle, during which the great questions of human development
were at stake. Great political conflicts have produced
deep passions and resulted in tragical situations; but
in Russia the great struggles and the religious movements
which took place in the seventeenth century, and under
Pugatchóff in the eighteenth, were uprisings of peasants, in
which the educated classes took no part. The intellectual
horizon of a Russian poet is thus necessarily limited. There
is, however, something in human nature which always lives
and appeals to every mind. This is love, and Púshkin, in his
lyric poetry, represented love under so many aspects, in such
beautiful forms, and with such a variety of shades, as one
finds in no other poet. Besides, he often gave to love an expression
so refined, so high, that his higher comprehension of
love left as deep a stamp upon subsequent Russian literature
as Goethe’s refined types of women left in the world’s literature.
After Púshkin had written, it was impossible for
Russian poets to speak of love in a lower sense than he did.</p>

<p>In Russia Púshkin has sometimes been described as a Russian
Byron. This appreciation, however, is hardly correct.
He certainly imitated Byron in some of his poems, although
the imitation became, at least in <i>Evghéniy Onyéghin</i>, a brilliant
original creation. He certainly was deeply impressed by
Byron’s spirited protest against the conventional life of
European society, and there was a time when, if he only
could have left Russia, he probably would have joined Byron
in Greece.</p>

<p>But, with his light character, Púshkin could not fathom,
and still less share, the depth of hatred and contempt
towards post-revolutionary Europe which consumed Byron’s
heart. Púshkin’s “Byronism” was superficial; and, while
he was ready to defy “respectable” society, he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
neither the longings for freedom nor the hatred of hypocrisy
which inspired Byron.</p>

<p>Altogether, Púshkin’s force was not in his elevating or
freedom-inspiring influence. His epicureanism, his education
received from French <i>emigrés</i>, and his life amidst the high
and frivolous classes of St. Petersburg society, prevented
him from taking to heart the great problems which were already
ripening in Russian life. This is why, towards the end
of his short life, he was no longer in touch with those of
his readers who felt that to glorify the military power of
Russia, after the armies of Nicholas I. had crushed Poland,
was not worthy of a poet; and that to describe the attractions
of a St. Petersburg winter-season for a rich and idle gentleman
was not to describe Russian life, in which the horrors
of serfdom and absolutism were being felt more and more
heavily.</p>

<p>Púshkin’s real force was in his having created in a few
years the Russian literary language, and having freed literature
from the theatrical, pompous style which was formerly
considered necessary in whatever was printed in black and
white. He was great in his stupendous powers of poetical
creation: in his capacity of taking the commonest things of
everyday life, or the commonest feelings of the most ordinary
person, and of so relating them that the reader lived
them through; and, on the other side, constructing out of the
scantiest materials, and calling to life, a whole historical
epoch—a power of creation which, of those coming after him,
only Tolstóy has to the same extent. Púshkin’s power was
next in his profound realism—that realism, understood in its
best sense, which he was the first to introduce in Russia, and
which, we shall see, became afterwards characteristic of the
whole of Russian literature. And it is in the broadly humanitarian
feelings with which his best writings are permeated,
in his bright love of life, and his respect for women. As to
beauty of form, his verses are so “easy” that one knows
them by heart after having read them twice or thrice. Now
that they have penetrated into the villages, they are the
delight of millions of peasant children, after having been the
delight of such refined and philosophical poets as Turguéneff.</p>

<p>Púshkin also tried his hand at the drama; and, so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
may be judged from his latest productions, <i>Don Juan</i> and
<i>The Miser-Knight</i>, he surely would have achieved great results
had he lived to continue them. His <i>Mermaid</i> (<i>Rusálka</i>)
unfortunately remained unfinished, but its dramatic
qualities can be judged from what Darmýzhsky has made of
it in his opera. His historical drama, <i>Boris Godunóff</i>, taken
from the times of the pretender Demetrius, is enlivened here
and there by most beautiful scenes, some of them very amusing,
and some of them containing a delicate analysis of the
sentiments of love and ambition; but it remains rather a
dramatic chronicle than a drama. As to <i>The Miser-Knight</i>,
it shows an extraordinary power of mature talent, and contains
passages undoubtedly worthy of Shakespeare; while
<i>Don Juan</i>, imbued with a true Spanish atmosphere, gives a
far better comprehension of the Don Juan type than any
other representation of it in any literature, and has all the
qualities of a first-rate drama.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his very short life a note of deeper
comprehension of human affairs began to appear in Púshkin’s
writings. He had had enough of the life of the higher
classes; and, when he began to write a history of the great
peasant uprising which took place under Pugatchóff during
the reign of Catherine II., he began also to understand and
to feel the inner springs of the life of the Russian peasant-class.
National life appeared to him under a much broader
aspect than before. But at this stage of the development of
his genius his career came to a premature end. He was
killed, as already stated, in a duel with a society man.</p>

<p>The most popular work of Púshkin is his novel in verse,
<i>Evghéniy Onyéghin</i>. In its form it has much in common with
Byron’s <i>Childe Harold</i>, but it is thoroughly Russian, and
contains perhaps the best description of Russian life, both in
the capitals and on the smaller estates of noblemen in the
country, that has ever been written in Russian literature.
Tchaykóvsky, the musician, has made of it an opera which
enjoys a great success on the Russian stage. The hero of the
novel, Onyéghin, is a typical representative of what society
people were at that time. He has received a superficial education,
partly from a French <i>emigré</i>, partly from a German
teacher, and has learned “something and anyhow.” At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the age of nineteen he is the owner of a great fortune—consisting,
of course, of serfs, about whom he does not care in
the least—and he is engulfed in the “high-life” of St. Petersburg.
His day begins very late, with reading scores of invitations
to tea-parties, evening parties, and fancy balls. He is,
of course, a visitor at the theatre, in which he prefers ballet
to the clumsy productions of the Russian dramatists; and
he spends a good deal of his day in fashionable restaurants,
while his nights are given to balls, where he plays the part
of a disillusioned young man, who is tired of life, and wraps
himself in the mantle of Byronism. For some reason or other
he is compelled to spend a summer on his estate, where he
has for a neighbour a young poet, educated in Germany and
full of German romanticism. They become great friends,
and they make acquaintance with a squire’s family in their
neighbourhood. The head of the family—the old mother—is
admirably described. Her two daughters, Tatiána and
Olga, are very different in nature: Olga is a quite artless
girl, full of the joy of living, who worries herself with no
questions, and the young poet is madly in love with her; they
are going to marry. As to Tatiána, she is a poetical girl, and
Púshkin bestows on her all the wonderful powers of his
talent, describing her as an ideal woman: intelligent,
thoughtful, and inspired with vague aspirations towards
something better than the prosaic life which she is compelled
to live. Onyéghin produces upon her, from the first, a deep
impression: she falls in love with him; but he, who has made
so many conquests in the high circles of the capital, and now
wears the mask of disgust of life, takes no notice of the
naïve love of the poor country girl. She writes to him and
tells him her love with great frankness and in most pathetic
words; but the young snob finds nothing better to do than to
lecture her about her rashness, and seems to take great
pleasure in turning the knife in her wound. At the same time,
at a small country ball Onyéghin, moved by some spirit of
mischief, begins to flirt in the most provoking way with the
other sister, Olga. The young girl seems to be delighted with
the attention paid to her by the gloomy hero, and the result
is that the poet provokes his friend to a duel. An old retired
officer, a true duelist, is mixed up in the affair, and Onyéghin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
who cares very much about what the country gentlemen,
whom he pretends to despise, may say about him, accepts the
provocation and fights the duel. He kills his poet friend and is
compelled to leave the country. Several years pass. Tatiána,
recovered from an illness, goes one day to the house where
formerly Onyéghin stayed and, making friends with an old
keeper, spends days and months reading in his library; but
life has no attraction for her. After insistent supplication
from her mother, she goes to Moscow, and there she marries
an old general. This marriage brings her to St. Petersburg,
where she plays a prominent part in the Court circles. In
these surroundings Onyéghin meets her once more, and
hardly recognises his Tánya in the worldly lady whom he sees
now; he falls madly in love with her. She takes no notice of
him, and his letters remain unanswered. At last one day he
goes, at an unseemly hour, into her house. He finds her reading
his letters, her eyes full of tears, and makes her a
passionate declaration of his love. To this Tatiána replies
by a monologue which is so beautiful that it ought to be
quoted here, if there existed an English translation which
rendered at least the touching simplicity of Tatiána’s words,
and consequently the beauty of the verses. A whole generation
of Russian women have cried over this monologue, as
they were reading these lines:</p>

<p>“Onyéghin, I was younger then, and better looking, I
suppose; and I loved you” ... but the love of a country
girl offered nothing new to Onyéghin. He paid no attention
to her.... “Why then does he follow her now at every
step? Why such display of his attention? Is it because she
is now rich and belongs to the high society, and is well
received at Court?</p>

<p>How many thousands of young Russian women have later
on repeated these same verses, and said to themselves: “I
would gladly give up all these rags and all this masquerade
of luxurious life for a small shelf of books, for life in the
country, amidst the peasants, and for the grave of my old
nurse in our village.” How many have done it! And we
shall see how this same type of Russian girl was developed
still further in the novels of Turguéneff—and in Russian
life. Was not Púshkin a great poet to have foreseen and
predicted it?</p>

<h3>LÉRMONTOFF</h3>

<p>It is said that when Turguéneff and his great friend,
Kavélin, came together—Kavélin was a very sympathetic
philosopher and a writer upon law—a favourite theme of
their discussions was: “Púshkin or Lérmontoff?” Turguéneff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
as is known, considered Púshkin one of the greatest
poets, and especially one of the greatest artists, among men;
while Kavélin must have insisted upon the fact that in his
best productions Lérmontoff was but slightly inferior to
Púshkin as an artist, that his verses were real music, while
at the same time the inspiration of his poetry was of a much
higher standard than that of Púshkin. When it is added that
eight years was the entire limit of Lérmontoff’s literary
career—he was killed in a duel at the age of twenty-six—the
powers and the potentialities of this poet will be seen
at once.</p>

<p>Lérmontoff had Scotch blood in his veins. At least, the
founder of the family was a Scotchman, George Learmonth,
who, with sixty Scotchmen and Irishmen, entered the service
of Poland first, and afterwards, in 1613, of Russia. The inner
biography of the poet remains still but imperfectly known. It
is certain that his childhood and boyhood were anything but
happy. His mother was a lover of poetry—perhaps a poet
herself; but he lost her when he was only three years old—she
was only twenty-one. His aristocratic grandmother
on the maternal side took him from his father—a poor
army officer, whom the child worshipped—and educated
him, preventing all intercourse between the father and the
son. The boy was very gifted, and at the age of fourteen had
already begun to write verses and poems—first in French,
(like Púshkin), and soon in Russian. Schiller and Shakespeare
and, from the age of sixteen, Byron and Shelley were
his favourites. At the age of sixteen Lérmontoff entered
the Moscow University, from which he was, however, excluded
next year for some offence against a very uninteresting
professor. He then entered a military school at St. Petersburg,
to become at the age of eighteen an officer of the
hussars.</p>

<p>A young man of twenty-two, Lérmontoff suddenly became
widely known for a piece of poetry which he wrote on the
occasion of Púshkin’s death (1837). A great poet, as well
as a lover of liberty and a foe of oppression, was revealed at
once in this passionate production of the young writer, of
which the concluding verses were especially powerful. “But
you,” he wrote, “who stand, a haughty crowd, around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
throne, You hang men of genius, of liberty, and fame! You
have now the law to cover you, And justice must close her lips
before you! But there is a judgment of God,—you, dissolute
crowd! There is a severe judge who waits for you. You will
not buy him by the sound of your gold.... And, with all
your black blood, You will not wash away the stain of the
poet’s pure blood!” In a few days all St. Petersburg, and
very soon all Russia, knew these verses by heart; they circulated
in thousands of manuscript copies.</p>

<p>For this passionate cry of his heart, Lérmontoff was
exiled at once. Only the intervention of his powerful friends
prevented him from being marched straight to Siberia. He
was transferred from the regiment of guards to which he
belonged to an army regiment in the Caucasus. Lérmontoff
was already acquainted with the Caucasus: he had been
taken there as a child of ten, and he had brought back from
this sojourn an ineffaceable impression. Now the grandeur
of the great mountain range impressed him still more forcibly.
The Caucasus is one of the most beautiful regions on
earth. It is a chain of mountains much greater than the Alps,
surrounded by endless forests, gardens, and steppes, situated
in a southern climate, in a dry region where the transparency
of the air enhances immensely the natural beauty
of the mountains. The snow-clad giants are seen from
the Steppes scores of miles away, and the immensity of the
chain produces an impression which is equalled nowhere in
Europe. Moreover, a half-tropical vegetation clothes the
mountain slopes, where the villages nestle, with their semi-military
aspect and their turrets, basking in all the gorgeous
sunshine of the East, or concealed in the dark shadows of
the narrow gorges, and populated by a race of people among
the most beautiful of Europe. Finally, at the time Lérmontoff
was there the mountaineers were fighting against the
Russian invaders with unabated courage and daring for
each valley of their native mountains.</p>

<p>All these natural beauties of the Caucasus have been reflected
in Lérmontoff’s poetry, in such a way that in no other
literature are there descriptions of nature so beautiful, or so
impressive and correct. Bodenstedt, his German translator
and personal friend, who knew the Caucasus well, was quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
right in observing that they are worth volumes of geographical
descriptions. The reading of many volumes about the
Caucasus does not add any concrete features to those which
are impressed upon the mind by reading the poems of Lérmontoff.
Turguéneff quotes somewhere Shakespeare’s description
of the sea as seen from the cliffs of Dover (in <i>King
Lear</i>), as a masterpiece of objective poetry dealing with
nature. I must confess, however, that the concentration of
attention upon small details in this description does not
appeal to my mind. It gives no impression of the immensity
of the sea as seen from the Dover cliffs, nor of the wonderful
richness of colour displayed by the waters on a
sunny day. No such reproach could ever be made against
Lérmontoff’s poetry of nature. Bodenstedt truly says that
Lérmontoff has managed to satisfy at the same time both
the naturalist and the lover of art. Whether he describes
the gigantic chain, where the eye loses itself—here in snow
clouds, there in the unfathomable depths of narrow gorges;
or whether he mentions some detail: a mountain stream,
or the endless woods, or the smiling valleys of Georgia
covered with flowers, or the strings of light clouds floating
in the dry breezes of Northern Caucasia,—he always
remains so true to nature that his picture rises before the
eye in life-colours, and yet it is imbued with a poetical
atmosphere which makes one feel the freshness of these
mountains, the balm of their forests and meadows, the purity
of the air. And all this is written in verses wonderfully
musical. Lérmontoff’s verses, though not so “easy” as Púshkin’s,
are very often even more musical. They sound like a
beautiful melody. The Russian language is always rather
melodious, but in the verses of Lérmontoff it becomes
almost as melodious as Italian.</p>

<p>The intellectual aspect of Lérmontoff is nearer to Shelley
than to any other poet. He was deeply impressed by the
author of <i>Prometheus Bound</i>; but he did not try to imitate
Shelley. In his earliest productions he did indeed imitate
Púshkin and Púshkin’s Byronism; but he very soon struck
a line of his own. All that can be said is, that the mind
of Lérmontoff was disquieted by the same great problems
of Good and Evil struggling in the human heart, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
the universe at large, which disquieted Shelley. Like
Shelley among the poets, and like Schopenhauer among
the philosophers, he felt the coming of that burning need
of a revision of the moral principles now current, so
characteristic of our own times. He embodied these ideas
in two poems, <i>The Demon</i> and <i>Mtsýri</i>, which complete each
other. The leading idea of the first is that of a fierce soul
which has broken with both earth and heaven, and looks
with contempt upon all who are moved by petty passions.
An exile from paradise and a hater of human virtues, he
knows these petty passions, and despises them with all his
superiority. The love of this demon towards a Georgian girl
who takes refuge from his love in a convent, and dies there—what
more unreal subject could be chosen? And yet, on
reading the poem, one is struck at every line by its incredible
wealth of purely realistic, concrete descriptions of scenes
and of human feelings, all of the most exquisite beauty. The
dance of the girl at her Georgian castle before the wedding,
the encounter of the bridegroom with robbers and his death,
the galloping of his faithful horse, the sufferings of the bride
and her retirement to a convent, nay, the love itself of the
demon and every one of the demon’s movements—this is of
the purest realism in the highest sense of the word: that
realism with which Púshkin had stamped Russian literature
once and for all.</p>

<p><i>Mtsýri</i> is the cry of a young soul longing for liberty. A
boy, taken from a Circassian village, from the mountains,
is brought up in a small Russian monastery. The monks think
that they have killed in him all human passions and longings;
but the dream of his childhood is—be it only once, be
it only for a moment—to see his native mountains where
his sisters sang round his cradle, and to press his burning
bosom against the heart of one who is not a stranger. One
night, when a storm rages and the monks are praying in
fear in their church, he escapes from the monastery, and
wanders for three days in the woods. For once in his life he
enjoys a few moments of liberty; he feels all the energy and
all the forces of his youth: “As for me, I was like a wild
beast,” he says afterwards, “and I was ready to fight with
the storm, the lightning, the tiger of the forest.” But, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
an exotic plant, weakened by education, he does not find his
way to his native country. He is lost in the forests which
spread for hundreds of miles round him, and is found a few
days later, exhausted, not far from the monastery. He dies
from the wounds which he has received in a fight with a
leopard.</p>

<p>“The grave does not frighten me,” he says to the old
monk who attends him. “Suffering, they say, goes to sleep
there in the eternal cold stillness. But I regret to part with
life.... I am young, still young.... hast thou ever
known the dreams of youth? Or hast thou forgotten how thou
once lovedst and hatedst? Maybe, this beautiful world has
lost for thee its beauty. Thou art weak and grey; thou hast
lost all desires. No matter! Thou hast lived once; thou hast
something to forget in this world. Thou hast lived—I might
have lived, too!” And he tells about the beauty of the nature
which he saw when he had run away, his frantic joy at feeling
free, his running after the lightning, his fight with a leopard.
“Thou wishest to know what I did while I was free?—I
lived, old man! I lived! And my life, without these three
happy days, would have been gloomier and darker than thy
powerless old age!” But it is impossible to <i>tell</i> all the
beauties of this poem. It must be read, and let us hope that a
good translation of it will be published some day.</p>

<p>Lérmontoff’s demonism or pessimism was not the pessimism
of despair, but a militant protest against all that is
ignoble in life, and in this respect his poetry has deeply impressed
itself upon all our subsequent literature. His pessimism
was the irritation of a strong man at seeing others
round him so weak and so base. With his inborn feeling of
the Beautiful, which evidently can never exist without the
True and the Good, and at the same time surrounded—especially
in the worldly spheres he lived in, and on the Caucasus—by
men and women who could not or did not dare to
understand him, he might easily have arrived at a pessimistic
contempt and hatred of mankind; but he always maintained
his faith in the higher qualities of man. It was quite natural
that in his youth—especially in those years of universal reaction,
the thirties—Lérmontoff should have expressed his
discontent with the world in such a general and abstract creation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
as is <i>The Demon</i>. Something similar we find even with
Schiller. But gradually his pessimism took a more concrete
form. It was not mankind altogether, and still less heaven
and earth, that he despised in his latter productions, but the
negative features of his own generation. In his prose novel,
<i>The Hero of our Own Time</i>, in his <i>Thoughts (Duma)</i>, etc.,
he perceived higher ideals, and already in 1840—<i>i. e.</i>, one
year before his death—he seemed ready to open a new page
in his creation, in which his powerfully constructive and critical
mind would have been directed towards the real evils of
actual life, and real, positive good would apparently have
been his aim. But it was at this very moment that, like Púshkin,
he fell in a duel.</p>

<p>Lérmontoff was, above all, a “humanist,”—a deeply
humanitarian poet. Already at the age of twenty-three, he
had written a poem from the times of John the Terrible,
<i>Song about the Merchant Kaláshnikoff</i>, which is rightly considered
as one of the best gems of Russian literature, both for
its powers, its artistic finish, and its wonderful epic style. The
poem, which produced a great impression when it became
known in Germany in Bodenstedt’s translation, is imbued
with the fiercest spirit of revolt against the courtiers of the
Terrible Tsar.</p>

<p>Lérmontoff deeply loved Russia, but not the official
Russia: not the crushing military power of a fatherland,
which is so dear to the so-called patriots, and he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I love my fatherland; but strange that love,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>In spite of all my reasoning may say;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Its glory, bought by shedding streams of blood,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Its quietness, so full of fierce disdain,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And the traditions of its gloomy past</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Do not awake in me a happy vision.</i>...</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What he loved in Russia was its country life, its plains, the
life of its peasants. He was inspired at the same time with a
deep love towards the natives of the Caucasus, who were
waging their bitter fight against the Russians for their liberty.
Himself a Russian, and a member of two different expeditions
against the Circassians, his heart throbbed nevertheless in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
sympathy with that brave, warm-hearted people in their
struggle for independence. One poem, <i>Izmail-Bey</i>, is an
apotheosis of this struggle of the Circassians against the Russians;
in another, one of his best—a Circassian is described
as fleeing from the field of battle to run home to his
village, and there his mother herself repudiates him as a
traitor. Another gem of poetry, one of his shorter poems,
<i>Valérik</i>, is considered by those who know what real warfare
is as the most correct description of it in poetry. And yet,
Lérmontoff disliked war, and he ends one of his admirable
descriptions of fighting with these lines:</p>

<p>“I thought: How miserable is man! What does he want? The
sky is pure, and under it there’s room for all; but without reason and
necessity, his heart is full of hatred.—Why?”</p>
</div>

<p>He died in his twenty-seventh year. Exiled for a second
time to the Caucasus (for a duel which he had fought at St.
Petersburg with a Barrante, the son of the French ambassador),
he was staying at Pyatigórsk, frequenting the shallow
society which usually comes together in such watering places.
His jokes and sarcasms addressed to an officer, Martýnoff,
who used to drape himself in a Byronian mantle the better to
capture the hearts of young girls, led to a duel. Lérmontoff,
as he had already done in his first duel, shot sideways purposely;
but Martýnoff slowly and purposely took his aim so
as even to call forth the protests of the seconds—and killed
Lérmontoff on the spot.</p>

<h3>PÚSHKIN AND LÉRMONTOFF AS PROSE-WRITERS</h3>

<p>Towards the end of his life Púshkin gave himself more and
more to prose writing. He began an extensive history of the
peasant uprising of 1773 under Pugatchóff, and undertook
for that purpose a journey to East Russia, where he collected,
besides public documents, personal reminiscences and popular
traditions relating to this uprising. At the same time he also
wrote a novel, <i>The Captain’s Daughter</i>, the scene of which
was laid in that disturbed period. The novel is not very
remarkable in itself. True, the portraits of Pugatchóff and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
an old servant, as well as the description of the whole life
in the small forts of East Russia, garrisoned at that time by
only a few invalid soldiers, are very true to reality and brilliantly
pictured; but in the general construction of the novel
Púshkin paid a tribute to the sentimentalism of the times.
Nevertheless, <i>The Captain’s Daughter</i>, and especially the
other prose novels of Púshkin, have played an important part
in the history of Russian literature. Through them Púshkin
introduced into Russia the realistic school, long before
Balzac did so in France, and this school has since that time
prevailed in Russian prose-literature. I do not mean, of
course, Realism in the sense of dwelling mainly upon the
lowest instincts of man, as it was misunderstood by some
French writers, but in the sense of treating both high and
low manifestations of human nature in a way true to reality,
and in their real proportions. Moreover, the <i>simplicity</i> of
these novels, both as regards their plots and the way the
plots are treated, is simply marvellous, and in this way they
have traced the lines upon which the development of Russian
novel writing has ever since been pursued. The novels of
Lérmontoff, of Hérzen (<i>Whose Fault?</i>), and of Turguéneff
and Tolstóy descend, I dare to say, in a much more direct
line from Púshkin’s novels than from those of Gógol.</p>

<p>Lérmontoff also wrote one novel in prose, <i>The Hero of our
Own Time</i>, of which the hero, Petchórin, was to some extent
a real representative of a portion of the educated society
in those years of romanticism. It is true that some critics
saw in him the portraiture of the author himself and his
acquaintances; but, as Lérmontoff wrote in his preface to
a second edition of this novel—“The hero of our own
time is indeed a portrait, but not of one single man: it
is the portrait of the vices of our generation,”—the
book indicates “the illness from which this generation
suffers.”</p>

<p>Petchórin is an extremely clever, bold, enterprising man
who regards his surroundings with cold contempt. He is
undoubtedly a superior man, superior to Púshkin’s Onyéghin;
but he is, above all, an egotist who finds no better application
for his superior capacities than all sorts of mad adventures,
always connected with love-making. He falls in love with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Circassian girl whom he sees at a native festival. The girl is
also taken by the beauty and the gloomy aspect of the Russian.
To marry her is evidently out of question, because her
Mussulman relatives would never give her to a Russian.
Then, Petchórin daringly kidnaps her, with the aid of her
brother, and the girl is brought to the Russian fort, where
Petchórin is an officer. For several weeks she only cries and
never speaks a word to the Russian, but by and bye she
feels love for him. That is the beginning of the tragedy.
Petchórin soon has enough of the Circassian beauty; he
deserts her more and more for hunting adventures, and during
one of them she is kidnapped by a Circassian who loves
her, and who, on seeing that he cannot escape with her, kills
her with his dagger. For Petchórin this solution is almost
welcome.</p>

<p>A few years later the same Petchórin appears amidst Russian
society in one of the Caucasus watering towns. There
he meets with Princess Mary, who is courted by a young man—Grushnísky,—a
sort of Caucasian caricature of Byron,
draped in a mantle of contempt for mankind, but in reality a
very shallow sort of personage. Petchórin, who cares but
little for the Princess Mary, finds, however, a sort of wicked
pleasure in rendering Grushnítsky ridiculous in her eyes, and
uses all his wit to bring the girl to his feet. When this is done,
he loses all interest in her. He makes a fool of Grushnítsky,
and when the young man provokes him to a duel, he kills him.
This was the hero of the time, and it must be owned that it
was not a caricature. In a society free from care about the
means of living—it was of course in serfdom times, under
Nicholas I.—when there was no sort of political life in the
country, a man of superior ability very often found no issue
for his forces but in such adventures as Petchórin’s.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the novel is admirably written—that
it is full of living descriptions of Caucasus “society”;
that the characters are splendidly delineated, and that some
of them, like the old Captain Maxím Maxímytch, have remained
living types of some of the best specimens of mankind.
Through these qualities <i>The Hero of our own Time</i>, like
<i>Evghéniy Onyéghin</i>, became a model for quite a series of
subsequent novels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<h3>OTHER POETS AND NOVELISTS OF THE SAME EPOCH
KRYLÓFF</h3>

<p>The fable-writer <span class="smcap">Krylóff</span> (1768-1844) is perhaps the
Russian writer who is best known abroad. English readers
know him through the excellent work and translations of so
great a connoisseur of Russian literature and language as
Ralston was, and little can be added to what Ralston has said
of this eminently original writer.</p>

<p>He stands on the boundary between two centuries, and
reflects both the end of the one and the beginning of the other.
Up to 1807 he wrote comedies which, even more than the
other comedies of the time, were mere imitations from the
French. It was only in 1807-1809 that he found his true vocation
and began writing fables, in which domain he attained
the first rank, not only in Russia, but among the fable-writers
in all modern literatures. Many of his fables—at any rate,
the best known ones—are translations from Lafontaine; and
yet they are entirely original productions. Lafontaine’s animals
are academically educated French gentlemen; even the
peasants in his fables come from Versailles. There is nothing
of the sort in Krylóff. Every animal in his fables is a character—wonderfully
true to life. Nay, even the cadence of his
verses changes and takes a special aspect each time a new animal
is introduced—that heavy simpleton, the Bear, or the
fine and cunning Fox, or the versatile Monkey. Krylóff knew
every one of them intimately; he knew each of their movements,
and above all he had noticed and enjoyed long since
in his own self the humorous side of every one of the
dwellers of the forests or the companions of Man, before
he undertook to put them in his fables. This is why Krylóff
may be taken as the greatest fable-writer not only of Russia—where
he had a not to be neglected rival in <span class="smcap">Dmítreff</span>
(1760-1837)—but also of all nations of modern times.
True, there is no depth, no profound and cutting irony, in
Krylóff’s fables. Nothing but a good-natured, easy-going
irony, which made the very essence of his heavy frame, his
lazy habits, and his quiet contemplation. But, is this not the
true domain of fable, which must not be confounded with
satire?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>At the same time there is no writer who has better possessed
and better understood the true essence of the really
popular Russian language, the language spoken by the men
and women of the people. At a time when the Russian <i>littérateurs</i>
hesitated between the elegant, Europeanised style of
Karamzín, and the clumsy, half-Slavonic style of the nationalists
of the old school, Krylóff, even in his very first fables,
written in 1807, had already worked out a style which at
once gave him a quite unique position in Russian literature,
and which has not been surpassed even by such masters of the
popular Russian language as was Ostróvskiy and some of the
folk-novelists of a later epoch. For terseness, expressiveness
and strict adherence to the true spirit of the popularly-spoken
Russian, Krylóff has no rivals.</p>

<h3>THE MINOR POETS</h3>

<p>Several minor poets, contemporary of Púshkin and Lérmontoff,
and some of them their personal friends, must be
mentioned in this place. The influence of Púshkin was so
great that he could not but call to life a school of writers who
should try to follow in his steps. None of them reached such
a height as to claim to be considered a world poet; but each
of them has made his contribution in one way or another to
the development of Russian poetry, each one has had his
humanising and elevating influence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kózloff</span> (1779-1840) has reflected in his poetry the extremely
sad character of his life. At the age of about forty he
was stricken with paralysis, losing the use of his legs, and
soon after that his sight; but his poetical gift remained with
him, and he dictated to his daughter some of the saddest
elegies which Russian literature possesses, as also a great
number of our most perfect translations. His <i>Monk</i> made
everyone in Russia shed tears, and Púshkin hastened to acknowledge
the strength of the poem. Endowed with the
most wonderful memory—he knew by heart all Byron, all
the poems of Walter Scott, all Racine, Tasso, and Dante,—Kozlóff,
like Zhukóvskiy, with whom he had much in common,
made a great number of translations from various
languages, especially from the English idealists, and some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
his translations from the Polish, such as <i>The Crimean Sonnets</i>
of Mickiewicz, are real works of art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Délwig</span> (1798-1831) was a great personal friend of
Púshkin, whose comrade he was at the Lyceum. He represented
in Russian literature the tendency towards reviving
ancient Greek forms of poetry, but happily enough he tried
at the same time to write in the style of the Russian popular
songs, and the lyrics which he wrote in this manner especially
contributed to make of him a favourite poet of his own time.
Some of his romances have remained popular till now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baratýnskiy</span> (1800-1844) was another poet of the same
group of friends. Under the influence of the wild nature of
Finland, where he spent several years in exile, he became a
romantic poet, full of the love of nature, and also of melancholy,
and deeply interested in philosophical questions, to
which he could find no reply. He thus lacked a definite conception
of life, but what he wrote was clothed in a beautiful
form, and in very expressive, elegant verses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yazýkoff</span> (1803-1846) belongs to the same circle. He
was intimate with Púshkin, who much admired his verses. It
must be said, however, that the poetry of Yazýkoff had
chiefly an historical influence in the sense of perfecting the
forms of poetical expression. Unfortunately, he had to
struggle against almost continual illness, and he died just
when he had reached the full development of his talent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venevítinoff</span> (1805-1822) died at a still younger age;
but there is no exaggeration in saying that he promised to
become a great poet, endowed with the same depth of
philosophical conception as was Goethe, and capable of
attaining the same beauty of form. The few verses he wrote
during the last year of his life revealed the suddenly attained
maturity of a great poetical talent, and may be compared
with the verses of the greatest poets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince Alexander Odóevskiy</span> (1803-1839) and
<span class="smcap">Polezháeff</span> (1806-1838) are two other poets who died
very young, and whose lives were entirely broken by political
persecution. Odóevskiy was a friend of the Decembrists.
After the 14th of December, 1825, he was arrested, taken to
the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul, and then sentenced to
hard labour in Siberia, whence he was not released till twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
years later, to be sent as a soldier to the Caucasus. There he
became the friend of Lérmontoff, one of whose best elegies
was written on Odóevskiy’s death. The verses of Odóevskiy
(they were not printed abroad while he lived) lack finish, but
he was a real poet and a patriot too, as is seen from his
<i>Dream of a Poet</i>, and his historical poem, <i>Vasilkó</i>.</p>

<p>The fate of <span class="smcap">Polezháeff</span> was even more tragic. He was
only twenty years old—a brilliant student of the Moscow
University—when he wrote an autobiographical poem,
<i>Sáshka</i>, full of allusions to the evils of autocracy and of
appeals for freedom. This poem was shown to Nicholas I.,
who ordered the young poet to be sent as a soldier to an army
regiment. The duration of service was then twenty-five years,
and Polezháeff saw not the slightest chance of release. More
than that: for an unauthorised absence from his regiment
(he had gone to Moscow with the intention of presenting a
petition of release to the Tsar) he was condemned to receive
one thousand strokes with the sticks, and only by mere luck
escaped the punishment. He never succumbed to his fate, and
in the horrible barracks of those times he remained what he
was: a pupil of Byron, Lamartine, and Macpherson, never
broken, protesting against tyranny In verses that were written
in tears and blood. When he was dying from consumption in
a military hospital at Moscow Nicholas I. pardoned him:
his promotion to the grade of officer came when he was dead.</p>

<p>A similar fate befell the Little Russian poet <span class="smcap">Shevchénko</span>
(1814-1861), who, for some of his poetry, was sent in
1847 to a battalion as a common soldier. His epical poems
from the life of the free Cossacks in olden times, heart rending
poems from the life of the serfs, and lyrics, all written in
Little Russian and thoroughly popular in both form and content,
belong to the fine specimens of poetry of all nations.</p>

<p>Of prose writers of the same epoch only a few can be mentioned
in this book, and these in a few lines. <span class="smcap">Alexander
Bestúzheff</span> (1797-1837), who wrote under the <i>nom de
plume</i> of <span class="smcap">Marlínskiy</span>—one of the “Decembrists,” exiled
to Siberia, and later on sent to the Caucasus as a soldier—was
the author of very widely-read novels. Like Púshkin and Lérmontoff
he was under the influence of Byron, and described
“titanic passions” in Byron’s style, as also striking adventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
in the style of the French novelists of the Romantic
school; but he deserves at the same time to be regarded as the
first to write novels from Russian life in which matters of
social interest were discussed.</p>

<p>Other favourite novelists of the same epoch were:
<span class="smcap">Zagóskin</span> (1789-1852), the author of extremely popular
historical novels, <i>Yúriy Miloslávskiy</i>, <i>Róslavleff</i>, etc., all
written in a sentimentally patriotic style; <span class="smcap">Naryézhnyi</span>
(1780-1825), who is considered by some Russian critics as a
forerunner of Gógol, because he wrote already in the realistic
style, describing, like Gógol, the dark sides of Russian life;
and <span class="smcap">Lazhéchnikoff</span> (1792-1868), the author of a number
of very popular historical novels from Russian life.</p>

<p>With Gógol begins a new period of Russian literature,
which is called by Russian literary critics “the
Gógol period,” and which lasts to the present date.</p>

<p>Gógol was not a Great Russian. He was born in 1809, in
a Little Russian or Ukraïnian nobleman’s family. His father
had already displayed some literary talent and wrote a few
comedies in Little Russian, but Gógol lost him at an early
age. The boy was educated in a small provincial town, which
he left, however, while still young, and when he was only
nineteen he was already at St. Petersburg. At that time the
dream of his life was to become an actor, but the manager
of the St. Petersburg Imperial theatres did not accept him,
and Gógol had to look for another sphere of activity. The
Civil Service, in which he obtained the position of a subordinate
clerk, was evidently insufficient to interest him, and he
soon entered upon his literary career.</p>

<p>His début was in 1829, with little novels taken from the
village-life of Little Russia. <i>Nights on a Farm near Dikánka</i>,
soon followed by another series of stories entitled <i>Mírgorod</i>,
immediately won for him literary fame and introduced
him into the circle of Zhukóvskiy and Púshkin. The two poets
at once recognised Gógol’s genius, and received him with
open arms.</p>

<p>Little Russia differs considerably from the central parts
of the empire, <i>i. e.</i>, from the country round Moscow, which
is known as Great Russia. It has a more southern position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and everything southern has always a certain attraction
for northerners. The villages in Little Russia are not disposed
in streets as they are in Great Russia, but the white-washed
houses are scattered, as in Western Europe, in
separate little farms, each of which is surrounded by charming
little gardens. The more genial climate, the warm nights,
the musical language, the beauty of the race, which probably
contains a mixture of South Slavonian with Turkish and
Polish blood, the picturesque dress and the lyrical songs—all
these render Little Russia especially attractive for the Great
Russian. Besides, life in Little-Russian villages is more poetical
than it is in the villages of Great Russia. There is more
freedom in the relations between the young men and the
young girls, who freely meet before marriage; the stamp of
seclusion of the women which has been impressed by Byzantine
habits upon Moscow does not exist in Little Russia,
where the influence of Poland was prevalent. Little Russians
have also maintained numerous traditions and epic poems and
songs from the times when they were free Cossacks and used
to fight against the Poles in the north and the Turks in the
south. Having had to defend the Greek orthodox religion
against these two nations, they strictly adhere now to the
Russian Church, and one does not find in their villages the
same passion for scholastic discussions about the letter of
the Holy Books which is often met with in Great Russia
among the Non-conformists. Their religion has altogether
a more poetical aspect.</p>

<p>The Little-Russian language is certainly more melodious
than the Great Russian, and there is now a movement of some
importance for its literary development; but this evolution
has yet to be accomplished, and Gógol very wisely wrote in
Great Russian—that is, in the language of Zhukóvskiy,
Púshkin, and Lérmontoff. We have thus in Gógol a sort of
union between the two nationalities.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give here an idea of the humour
and wit contained in Gógol’s novels from Little Russian life,
without quoting whole pages. It is the good-hearted laughter
of a young man who himself enjoys the fulness of life and
himself laughs at the comical positions into which he has put
his heroes: a village chanter, a wealthy peasant, a rural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
matron, or a village smith. He is full of happiness; no dark
apprehension comes to disturb his joy of life. However, those
whom he depicts are not rendered comical in obedience to the
poet’s whim: Gógol always remains scrupulously true to reality.
Every peasant, every chanter, is taken from real life,
and the truthfulness of Gógol to reality is almost ethnographical,
without ever ceasing to be poetical. All the superstitions
of a village life on a Christmas Eve or during a mid-summer
night, when the mischievous spirits and goblins get free till
the cock crows, are brought before the reader, and at the
same time we have all the wittiness which is inborn in the
Little Russian. It was only later on that Gógol’s comical vein
became what can be truly described as “humour,”—that is, a
sort of contrast between comical surroundings and a sad substratum
of life, which made Púshkin say of Gógol’s productions
that “behind his laughter you feel the unseen tears.”</p>

<p>Not all the Little-Russian tales of Gógol are taken from
peasant life. Some deal also with the upper class of the small
towns; and one of them, <i>How Iván Ivánovitch quarrelled
with Iván Nikíforytch</i>, is one of the most humorous tales in
existence. Iván Ivánovitch and Iván Nikíforytch were two
neighbours who lived on excellent terms with each other; but
the inevitableness of their quarrelling some day appears from
the very first lines of the novel. Iván Ivánovitch was a person
of fine behaviour. He would never offer snuff to an acquaintance
without saying: “May I dare, Sir, to ask you to be so
kind as to oblige yourself.” He was a man of the most accurate
habits; and when he had eaten a melon he used to wrap
its seeds in a bit of paper, and to inscribe upon it: “This
melon was eaten on such a date,” and if there had been a
friend at his table he would add: “In the presence of Mr.
So and So.” At the same time he was, after all, a miser, who
appreciated very highly the comforts of his own life, but did
not care to share them with others. His neighbour, Iván
Nikíforytch, was quite the opposite. He was very stout and
heavy, and fond of swearing. On a hot summer day he would
take off all his clothes and sit in his garden, in the sunshine,
warming his back. When he offered snuff to anyone, he would
simply produce his snuff box saying: “Oblige yourself.” He
knew none of the refinements of his neighbour, and loudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
expressed what he meant. It was inevitable that two men, so
different, whose yards were only separated by a low fence,
should one day come to a quarrel; and so it happened.</p>

<p>One day the stout and rough Iván Nikíforytch, seeing that
his friend owned an old useless musket, was seized with the
desire to possess the weapon. He had not the slightest need of
it, but all the more he longed to have it, and this craving led
to a feud which lasted for years. Iván Ivánovitch remarked
very reasonably to his neighbour that he had no need of a
rifle. The neighbour, stung by this remark, replied that this
was precisely the thing he needed, and offered, if Iván Ivánovitch
was not disposed to accept money for his musket, to
give him in exchange—a pig.... This was understood by
Iván Ivánovitch as a terrible offence: “How could a musket,
which is the symbol of hunting, of nobility, be exchanged by
a gentleman for a pig!” Hard words followed, and the
offended neighbour called Iván Ivánovitch a gander....
A mortal feud, full of the most comical incidents, resulted
from these rash words. Their friends did everything to
re-establish peace, and one day their efforts seemed to be
crowned with success; the two enemies had been brought
together—both pushed from behind by their friends; Iván
Ivánovitch had already put his hand into his pocket to take
out his snuff-box and to offer it to his enemy, when the latter
made the unfortunate remark: “There was nothing particular
in being called a gander; no need to be offended by
that.”... All the efforts of the friends were brought to
nought by these unfortunate words. The feud was renewed
with even greater acrimony than before; and, tragedy always
following in the steps of comedy, the two enemies, by taking
the affair from one Court to another, arrived at old age
totally ruined.</p>

<h3>TARÁS BÚLBA—THE CLOAK</h3>

<p>The pearl of Gógol’s Little-Russian novels is an historical
novel, <i>Tarás Búlba</i>, which recalls to life one of the most interesting
periods in the history of Little Russia—the fifteenth
century. Constantinople had fallen into the hands of the
Turks; and although a mighty Polish-Lithuanian State had
grown in the West, the Turks, nevertheless, menaced both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Eastern and Middle Europe. Then it was that the Little
Russians rose for the defence of Russia and Europe. They
lived in free communities of Cossacks, over whom the Poles
were beginning to establish feudal power. In times of peace
these Cossacks carried on agriculture in the prairies, and fishing
in the beautiful rivers of Southwest Russia, reaching at
times the Black Sea; but every one of them was armed, and
the whole country was divided into regiments. As soon as
there was a military alarm they all rose to meet an invasion
of the Turks or a raid of the Tartars, returning to their
fields and fisheries as soon as the war was over.</p>

<p>The whole nation was thus ready to resist the invasions
of the Mussulmans; but a special vanguard was kept in the
lower course of the Dniéper, “beyond the rapids,” on an
island which soon became famous under the name of the
Sícha. Men of all conditions, including runaways from their
landlords, outlaws, and adventurers of all sorts, could come
and settle in the Sícha without being asked any questions but
whether they went to church. “Well, then, make the sign
of the cross,” the hetman of the Sícha said, “and join the
division you like.” The Sícha consisted of about sixty divisions,
which were very similar to independent republics, or
rather to schools of boys, who cared for nothing and lived in
common. None of them had anything of his own, excepting
his arms. No women were admitted, and absolute democracy
prevailed.</p>

<p>The hero of the novel is an old Cossack, Tarás Búlba, who
has himself spent many years in Sícha, but is now peacefully
settled inland on his farm. His two sons have been
educated at the Academy of Kíeff and return home after
several years of absence. Their first meeting with their father
is very characteristic. As the father laughs at the sons’ long
clothes, which do not suit a Cossack, the elder son, Ostáp,
challenges him to a good boxing fight. The father is delighted,
and they fight until the old man, quite out of breath,
exclaims: “By God, this is a good fighter; no need to test him
further; he will be a good Cossack!—Now, son, be welcome;
let us kiss each other.” On the very next day after their
arrival, without letting the mother enjoy the sight of her
sons, Tarás takes them to the Sícha, which—as often happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
in those times—was quickly drawn into war, in consequence
of the exactions which the Polish landlords made upon
the Little Russians.</p>

<p>The life of the free Cossacks in the republic “beyond the
rapids” and their ways of conducting war are wonderfully
described; but, paying a tribute to the then current romanticism,
Gógol makes Tarás’ younger son, a sentimentalist, fall
in love with a noble Polish lady, during the siege of a Polish
town, and go over to the enemy; while the father and the
elder son continue fighting the Poles. The war lasts for a
year or so, with varying success, till at length, in one of the
desperate sorties of the besieged Poles, the younger son of
Tarás is taken prisoner, and the father himself kills him for
his treason. The elder son is next taken prisoner by the Poles
and carried away to Warsaw, where he perishes on the rack;
while Tarás, returning to Little Russia, raises a formidable
army and makes one of those invasions into Poland with
which the history of the two countries was filled for two centuries.
Taken prisoner himself, Tarás perishes at the stake,
with a disregard of life and suffering which were characteristic
of this strong, fighting race of men. Such is, in brief, the
theme of this novel, which is replete with admirable separate
scenes.</p>

<p>Read in the light of modern requirements, Tarás Búlba
certainly would not satisfy us. The influence of the Romantic
school is too strongly felt. The younger son of Tarás is not
a living being, and the Polish lady is entirely invented in
order to answer the requirements of a novel, showing that
Gógol never knew a single woman of that type. But the old
Cossack and his son, as well as all the life of the Cossack
camps, is quite real; it produces the illusion of real life. The
reader is carried away in sympathy with old Tarás, while the
ethnographer cannot but feel that he has before him a
wonderful combination of an ethnographical document of
the highest value, with a poetical reproduction—only the
more real because it is poetical—of a bygone and most
interesting epoch.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Little-Russian novels were followed by a few novels
taken from the life of Great Russia, chiefly of St. Petersburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
and two of them, <i>The Memoirs of a Madman</i> and <i>The Cloak</i>
(<i>Shinél</i>) deserve a special mention. The psychology of the
madman is strikingly drawn. As to <i>The Cloak</i>, it is in this
novel that Gógol’s laughter which conceals “unseen tears”
shows at its best. The poor life of a small functionary, who
discovers with a sense of horror that his old cloak is so worn
out as to be unfit to stand further repairs; his hesitation
before he ventures to speak to a tailor about a new one; his
nervous excitement on the day that it is ready and that he tries
it on for the first time; and finally his despair, amidst general
indifference, when night-robbers have robbed him of his cloak—every
line of this work bears the stamp of one of the greatest
artists. Sufficient to say that this novel produced at its
appearance, and produces still, such an impression, that since
the times of Gógol every Russian novel-writer has been aptly
said to have re-written <i>The Cloak</i>.</p>

<h3>THE INSPECTOR-GENERAL</h3>

<p>Gógol’s prose-comedy, <i>The Inspector-General</i> (<i>Revizór</i>),
has become, in its turn, a starting point for the Russian
drama—a model which every dramatic writer after Gógol
has always kept before his eyes. “Revizór,” in Russian,
means some important functionary who has been sent by
the ministry to some provincial town to inquire into the conditions
of the local administration—an Inspector-General;
and the comedy takes place in a small town, from which
“you may gallop for three years and yet arrive nowhere.”
The little spot—we learn it at the rising of the curtain—is
going to be visited by an Inspector-General. The local
head of the Police (in those times the head of the Police
was also the head of the town)—the Gorodníchiy or Governor—has
convoked the chief functionaries of the place to
communicate to them an important news. He has had a
bad dream; two rats came in, sniffed and then went away;
there must be something in that dream, and so there is; he
has just got this morning a letter from a friend at St. Petersburg,
announcing that an inspector-general is coming, and—what
is still worse—is coming incognito! Now, the honourable
Governor advises the functionaries to put some order in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
their respective offices. The patients in the hospital walk
about in linen so dirty that you might take them for chimney
sweeps. The chief magistrate, who is a passionate lover of
sport, has his hunting apparel hanging about in the Court,
and his attendants have made a poultry-yard of the entrance
hall. In short, everything has to be put in order. The Governor
feels very uncomfortable. Up to the present day he has
freely levied tribute upon the merchants, pocketed the money
destined for building a church, and within a fortnight he
has flogged the wife of a non-commissioned officer, which he
had no right to do; and now, there’s the Inspector-General
coming! He asks the postmaster “just to open a little” the
letters which may be addressed from this town to St. Petersburg
and, if he finds in them some reports about town matters,
to keep them. The postmaster—a great student of human
character—has always indulged, even without getting this
advice, in the interesting pastime of reading the letters, and
he falls in with the Governor’s proposal.</p>

<p>At that very moment enter Petr Iványch Dóbchinsky and
Petr Iványch Bóbchinsky. Everyone knows them, you
know them very well: they play the part of the town
Gazette. They go about the town all day long, and as soon as
they have learnt something interesting they both hurry to
spread the news, interrupting each other in telling it, and
hurrying immediately to some other place to be the first to
communicate the news to someone else. They have been at
the only inn of the town, and there they saw a very suspicious
person: a young man, “who has something, you know,
extraordinary about his face.” He is living there for a fortnight,
never paying a penny, and does not journey any
further. “What is his object in staying so long in town like
ours?” And then, when they were taking their lunch he passed
them by and looked so inquisitively in their plates—who may
he be? Evidently, the Governor and all present conclude, he
must be the Inspector-General who stays there incognito....
A general confusion results from the suspicion.
The Governor starts immediately for the inn, to make the
necessary enquiries. The womenfolk are in a tremendous
excitement.</p>

<p>The stranger is simply a young man who is travelling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
rejoin his father. On some post-station he met with a certain
captain—a great master at cards—and lost all he had in
his pocket. Now he cannot proceed any farther, and he
cannot pay the landlord, who refuses to credit him with any
more meals. The young man feels awfully hungry—no wonder
he looked so inquisitively into the plates of the two
gentlemen—and resorts to all sorts of tricks to induce the
landlord to send him something for his dinner. Just as he is
finishing some fossil-like cutlet enters the Gorodníchiy; and
a most comic scene follows, the young man thinking that
the Governor came to arrest him, and the Governor thinking
that he is speaking to the Inspector-General who is trying
to conceal his identity. The Governor offers to remove the
young man to some more comfortable place. “No, thank
you, I have no intent to go to a jail,” sharply retorts the
young man.... But it is to his own house that the Governor
takes the supposed Inspector, and now an easy life
begins for the adventurer. All the functionaries appear in
turn to introduce themselves, and everyone is only too happy
to give him a bribe of a hundred roubles or so. The merchants
come to ask his protection from the Governor; the
widow who was flogged comes to lodge a complaint....
In the meantime the young man enters into a flirtation with
both the wife and the daughter of the Governor; and, finally,
being caught at a very pathetic moment when he is kneeling
at the feet of the daughter, without further thought he
makes a proposition of marriage. But, having gone so far,
the young man, well-provided now with money, hastens to
leave the town on the pretext of going to see an uncle; he
will be back in a couple of days....</p>

<p>The delight of the Governor can easily be imagined. His
Excellency, the Inspector-General, going to marry the Governor’s
daughter! He and his wife are already making all
sorts of plans. They will remove to St. Petersburg, the
Gorodníchiy will soon be a general, and you will see how
he will keep the other Gorodníchies at his door!... The
happy news spreads about the town, and all the functionaries
and the society of the town hasten to offer their congratulations
to the old man. There is a great gathering at his
house—when the postmaster comes in. He has followed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
advice of the Governor, and has opened a letter which the
supposed Inspector-General had addressed to somebody at
St. Petersburg. He now brings this letter. The young man
is no inspector at all, and here is what he writes to a Bohemian
friend of his about his adventures in the provincial
town:<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In short, the letter produces a great sensation. The friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of the Governor are delighted to see him and his family in
such straits, all accuse each other, and finally fall upon the
two gentlemen, when a police soldier enters the room and
announces in a loud voice: “A functionary from St. Petersburg,
with Imperial orders, wants to see you all immediately.
He stays at the hotel.” Thereupon the curtain drops over a
living picture of which Gógol himself had made a most striking
sketch in pencil, and which is usually reproduced in his
works; it shows how admirably well, with what a fine artistic
sense, he represented to himself his characters.</p>

<p><i>The Inspector-General</i> marks a new era in the development
of dramatic art in Russia. All the comedies and dramas
which were being played in Russia at that time (with the
exception, of course, of <i>Misfortune from Intelligence</i>, which,
however, was not allowed to appear on the stage) hardly
deserved the name of dramatic literature: so imperfect and
puerile they were. <i>The Inspector-General</i>, on the contrary,
would have marked at the time of its appearance (1835) an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
epoch in any language. Its stage qualities, which will be
appreciated by every good actor; its sound and hearty
humour; the natural character of the comical scenes, which
result from the very characters of those who appear in this
comedy; the sense of measure which pervades it—all these
make it one of the best comedies in existence. If the conditions
of life which are depicted here were not so exclusively
Russian, and did not so exclusively belong to a bygone stage
of life which is unknown outside Russia, it would have
been generally recognised as a real pearl of the world’s literature.
This is why, when it was played a few years ago in
Germany, by actors who properly understood Russian life,
it achieved such a tremendous success.</p>

<p><i>The Inspector-General</i> provoked such a storm of hostile
criticism on the part of all reactionary Russia, that it was
hopeless to expect that the comedy which Gógol began next,
concerning the life of the St. Petersburg functionaries (<i>The
Vladimir Cross</i>), could ever be admitted on the stage, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Gógol never finished it, only publishing a few striking scenes
from it: <i>The Morning of a Busy Man</i>, <i>The Law Suit</i>, etc.
Another comedy, <i>Marriage</i>, in which he represented the
hesitation and terror through which an inveterate bachelor
goes before a marriage, which he finally eludes by jumping
out of a window a few moments before the beginning of the
ceremony, has not lost its interest even now. It is so full of
comical situations, which fine actors cannot but highly appreciate,
that it is still a part of the current <i>répertoire</i> of the
Russian stage.</p>

<h3>DEAD SOULS</h3>

<p>Gógol’s main work was <i>Dead Souls</i>. This is a novel almost
without a plot, or rather with a plot of the utmost simplicity.
Like the plot of <i>The Inspector-General</i>, it was suggested
to Gógol by Púshkin. In those times, when serfdom was
flourishing in Russia, the ambition of every nobleman was
to become the owner of at least a couple of hundred serfs.
The serfs used to be sold like slaves and could be bought
separately. A needy nobleman, Tchítchikoff, conceives accordingly
a very clever plan. A census of the population being
made only every ten or twenty years, and every serf-owner
having in the interval to pay taxes for every male soul which
he owned at the time of the last census, even though part of
his “souls” be dead since, Tchítchikoff conceives the idea
of taking advantage of this anomaly. He will buy the dead
souls at a very small expense: the landlords will be only
too pleased to get rid of this burden and surely will sell them
for anything; and after Tchítchikoff has bought two or three
hundred of these imaginary serfs, he will buy cheap land
somewhere in the southern prairies, transfer the dead souls,
on paper, to that land, register them as if they were really
settled there, and mortgage that new sort of estate to the
State Landlords’ Bank. In this way he can easily make the
beginnings of a fortune. With this plan Tchítchikoff comes
to a provincial town and begins his operations. He makes,
first of all, the necessary visits.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The newcomer made visits to all the functionaries of the town.
He went to testify his respects to the Governor, who like Tchítchikoff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
himself, was neither stout nor thin. He was decorated with a cross
and was spoken of as a person who would soon get a star; but was,
after all, a very good fellow and was fond of making embroideries
upon fine muslin. Tchítchikoff’s next visits were to the Vice-Governor,
to the Chief Magistrate, to the Chief of Police, the Head
of the Crown Factories ... but it is so difficult to remember
all the powerful persons in this world ... sufficient to say that
the newcomer showed a wonderful activity as regards visits. He
even went to testify his respects to the Sanitary Inspector, and to
the Town Surveyor, and after that he sat for a long time in his
carriage trying to remember to whom else he might pay a visit;
but he could think of no more functionaries in the town. In his
conversations with all these influential persons he managed to say
something to flatter every one of them. In talking with the Governor
he accidentally dropped the remark that when one enters this province
one thinks of paradise—all the roads being quite like velvet; and
that ‘governments which nominate wise functionaries surely deserve
universal gratitude.’ To the Chief of the Police he said something
very gratifying about the police force, and while he was talking
to the Vice-Governor and to the presiding magistrate, who were
only State-Councillors, he twice made the mistake of calling them
‘Your Excellency,’ with which mistake they were both immensely
pleased. The result of all this was that the Governor asked Tchítchikoff
to come that same day to an evening party, and the other functionaries
invited him, some to dine with them, others to a cup of tea,
and others again to a party of whist.</p>

<p>“About himself Tchítchikoff avoided talking, and if he spoke at
all it was in vague sentences only, with a remarkable modesty, his
conversation taking in such cases a rather bookish turn. He said
that he was a mere nobody in this world and did not wish people to
take any particular interest in him; that he had had varied experiences
in his life, suffered in the service of the State for the sake of truth,
had had many enemies, some of whom had even attempted his life,
but that now, wishing to lead a quiet existence, he intended to find
at last some corner to live in, and, having come to this town, he considered
it his imperative duty to testify his respect to the chief functionaries
of the place. This was all they could learn in town about
the new person who soon made his appearance at the Governor’s
evening party.</p>

<p>“Here, the newcomer once more produced the most favourable
impression.... He always found out what he ought to do on
every occasion; and he proved himself an experienced man of the
world. Whatsoever the conversation might be about, he always knew
how to support it. If people talked about horses, he spoke about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
horses; if they began talking about the best hunting dogs, here also
Tchítchikoff would make remarks to the point. If the conversation
related to some inquest which was being made by the Government,
he would show that he also knew something about the tricks of the
Civil Service functionaries. When the talk was about billiards, he
showed that in billiards he could keep his own; if people talked
about virtue, he also spoke about virtue, even with tears in his eyes;
and if the conversation turned on making brandy, he knew all about
brandy; as to Custom officers, he knew everything about them, as
though he had himself been a Custom officer, or a detective; but the
most remarkable thing was that he knew how to cover all this with
a certain sense of propriety, and in every circumstance knew how to
behave. He never spoke too loudly, and never in too subdued a tone,
but exactly as one ought to speak. In short, take him from any side
you like, he was a very respectable man. All the functionaries were
delighted with the arrival of such a person in their town.”</p>
</div>

<p>It has often been said that Gógol’s Tchítchikoff is a truly
Russian type. But—is it so? Has not every one of us met
Tchítchikoff?—middle-aged; not too thick and not too thin;
moving about with the lightness almost of a military man....
The subject he wishes to speak to you about may offer
many difficulties, but he knows how to approach it and to
interest you in it in a thousand different ways. When he talks
to an old general he rises to the understanding of the greatness
of the country and her military glory. He is not a jingo—surely
not—but he has, just in the proper measure, the
love of war and victories which are required in a man who
wishes to be described as a patriot. When he meets with a
sentimental reformer, he is sentimental and desirous of
reforms, and so on, and he always will keep in view the
object he aims at at any given moment, and will try to interest
you in it. Tchítchikoff may buy dead souls, or railway shares,
or he may collect funds for some charitable institution, or
look for a position in a bank, but he is an immortal international
type; we meet him everywhere; he is of all lands
and of all times; he but takes different forms to suit the
requirements of nationality and time.</p>

<p>One of the first landlords to whom Tchítchikoff spoke of
his intention of buying dead souls was Maníloff—also a
universal type, with the addition of those special features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
which the quiet life of a serf-owner could add to such a
character. “A very nice man to look at,” as Gógol says;
his features possessed something very pleasant—only it
seemed as if too much sugar had been put into them. “When
you meet him for the first time you cannot but exclaim after
the first few minutes of conversation: ‘What a nice and
pleasant man he is.’ The next moment you say nothing, but
the next but one moment you say to yourself: ‘The deuce
knows what he is,’ and you go away; but if you don’t, you
feel mortally bored.” You could never hear from him a
lively or animated word. Everyone has some point of interest
and enthusiasm. Maníloff had nothing of the kind; he was
always in the same mild temper. He seemed to be lost in
reflection; but what about, no one knew. Sometimes, as he
looked from his window on his wide courtyard and the pond
behind, he would say to himself: “How nice it would be to
have there an underground passage leading from the mansion
to the pond, and to have across the pond a stone bridge,
with pretty shops on both its sides, in which shops all sorts
of things useful for the poor people could be bought.” His
eyes became in this case wonderfully soft, and his face took
on a most contented expression. However, even less strange
intentions remained mere intentions. In his house something
was always missing; his drawing room had excellent furniture
covered with fine silk stuff, which probably had cost
much money; but for two of the chairs there was not sufficient
of the stuff, and so they remained covered with plain sack-cloth;
and for many years in succession the proprietor used
to stop his guests with these words: “Please, do not take that
chair; it is not yet ready.” “His wife.... But they were
quite satisfied with each other. Although more than eight
years had passed since they had married, one of them would
still occasionally bring to the other a piece of apple or a
tiny sweet, or a nut, saying in a touchingly sweet voice which
expressed infinite love: ‘Open, my dearest, your little mouth,—I
will put into it this little sweet.’ Evidently the mouth
was opened in a very charming way. For her husband’s birthday
the wife always prepared some surprise—for instance,
an embroidered sheath for his tooth-pick, and very often,
sitting on the sofa, all of a sudden, no one knows for what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
reason, one of them would leave his pipe and the other her
work, and impress on each other such a sweet and long kiss
that during it one might easily smoke a little cigarette. In
short, they were what people call quite happy.”</p>

<p>It is evident that of his estate and of the condition of his
peasants Maníloff never thought. He knew absolutely nothing
about such matters, and left everything in the hands of a
very sharp manager, under whose rule Maníloff’s serfs were
worse off than under a brutal landlord. Thousands of
such Maníloffs peopled Russia some fifty years ago, and I
think that if we look closer round we shall find such would-be
“sentimental” persons under every latitude.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive what a gallery of portraits Gógol
was enabled to produce as he followed Tchítchikoff in his
wanderings from one landlord to another, while his hero tried
to buy as many “dead souls” as he could. Every one of the
landlords described in <i>Dead Souls</i>—the sentimentalist Maníloff,
the heavy and cunning Sobakévitch, the arch-liar and
cheat Nózdreff, the fossilised, antediluvian lady Koróbotchka,
the miser Plyúshkin—have become common names
in Russian conversation. Some of them, as for instance the
miser Plyúshkin, are depicted with such a depth of psychological
insight that one may ask one’s self whether a better
and more humane portrait of a miser can be found in any
literature?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Towards the end of his life Gógol, who was suffering
from a nervous disease, fell under the influence of “pietists”—especially
of Madame O. A. Smirnóff (born Rossett), and
began to consider all his writings as a sin of his life. Twice,
in a paroxysm of religious self-accusation, he burned the
manuscript of the second volume of <i>Dead Souls</i>, of which
only some parts have been preserved, and were circulated
in his lifetime in manuscript. The last ten years of his life
were extremely painful. He repented with reference to all
his writings, and published a very unwholesome book, <i>Correspondence
with Friends</i>, in which, under the mask of
Christian humility, he took a most arrogant position with
respect to all literature, his own writings included. He died
at Moscow in 1852.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>It hardly need be added that the Government of Nicholas
I. considered Gógol’s writings extremely dangerous. The
author had the utmost difficulties in getting permission for
<i>The Inspector-General</i> to be played at all on the stage, and
the permission was only obtained by Zhukóvskiy, at the
express will of the Tsar himself. Before the authorisation was
given to print the first volume of <i>Dead Souls</i>, Gógol had to
undergo most incredible trouble; and when the volume
was out of print a second edition was never permitted in
Nicholas I.’s reign. When Gógol died, and Turguéneff
published in a Moscow paper a short obituary notice, which
really contained absolutely nothing (“any tradesman might
have had a better one,” as Turguéneff himself said), the
young novelist was arrested, and it was only because of the
influence of his friends in high position that the punishment
which Nicholas I. inflicted upon him was limited to exile
from Moscow and a forced residence on his estate in the
country. Were it not for these influences, Turguéneff very
probably would have been exiled, like Púshkin and Lérmontoff,
either to the Caucasus or to Siberia.</p>

<p>The police of Nicholas I. were not wrong when they
attributed to Gógol a great influence upon the minds of
Russians. His works circulated immensely in manuscript
copies. In my childhood we used to copy the second volume
of <i>Dead Souls</i>—the whole book from beginning to end, as
well as parts from the first volume. Everyone considered then
this work as a formidable indictment against serfdom; and
so it was. In this respect Gógol was the forerunner of the
literary movement against serfdom which began in Russia
with such force, a very few years later, during and especially
after the Crimean War. Gógol never expressed his personal
ideas about this subject, but the life-pictures of serf-owners
which he gave and their relations to their serfs—especially
the waste of the labour of the serfs—were a stronger
indictment that if Gógol had related facts of brutal
behaviour of landlords towards their men. In fact, it is impossible
to read <i>Dead Souls</i> without being impressed by the
fact that serfdom was an institution which had produced its
own doom. Drinking, gluttony, waste of the serf’s labour
in order to keep hundreds of retainers, or for things as useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
as the sentimentalist Maníloff’s bridges, were characteristic
of the landlords; and when Gógol wanted to represent one
landlord who, at least, obtained some pecuniary advantage
from the forced labour of his serfs and enriched himself, he
had to produce a landlord who was not a Russian: in fact,
among the Russian landlords such a man would have been
a most extraordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>As to the literary influence of Gógol, it was immense, and
it continues down to the present day. Gógol was not a deep
thinker, but he was a very great artist. His art was pure
realism, but it was imbued with the desire of making for
mankind something good and great. When he wrote the most
comical things, it was not merely for the pleasure of laughing
at human weaknesses, but he also tried to awaken the
desire of something better and greater, and he always
achieved that aim. Art, in Gógol’s conception, is a torch-bearer
which indicates a higher ideal; and it was certainly
this high conception of art which induced him to give such
an incredible amount of time to the working out of the
schemes of his works, and afterwards, to the most careful
elaboration of every line which he published.</p>

<p>The generation of the Decembrists surely would have
introduced social and political ideas in the novel. But that
generation had perished, and Gógol was now the first to
introduce the social element into Russian literature, so as to
give it its prominent and dominating position. While it
remains an open question whether realism in the Russian
novel does not date from Púshkin, rather even than from
Gógol—this, in fact, is the view of both Turguéneff and
Tolstóy—there is yet no doubt that it was Gógol’s writings
which introduced into Russian literature the social element,
and social criticism based upon the analysis of the conditions
within Russia itself. The peasant novels of Grigoróvitch,
Turguéneff’s <i>Sportsman’s Notebook</i>, and the first works of
Dostoyévskiy were a direct outcome of Gógol’s initiative.</p>

<p>Realism in art was much discussed some time ago, in connection
chiefly with the first writings of Zola; but we,
Russians, who had had Gógol, and knew realism in its best
form, could not fall in with the views of the French realists.
We saw in Zola a tremendous amount of the same romanticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
which he combated; and in his realism, such as it
appeared in his writings of the first period, we saw a step
backwards from the realism of Balzac. For us, realism could
not be limited to a mere anatomy of society: it had to have
a higher background; the realistic description had to be made
subservient to an idealistic aim. Still less could we understand
realism as a description only of the lowest aspects of
life, because, to limit one’s observations to the lowest aspects
only, is <i>not</i> to be a realist. Real life has beside and within
its lowest manifestations its highest ones as well. Degeneracy
is not the sole nor dominant feature of modern society, if
we look at it as a whole. Consequently, the artist who limits
his observations to the lowest and most degenerate aspects
only, and not for a special purpose, does not make us understand
that he explores only one small corner of life. Such
an artist does not conceive life <i>as it is</i>: he knows but one
aspect of it, and this is not the most interesting one.</p>

<p>Realism in France was certainly a necessary protest, partly
against unbridled Romanticism, but chiefly against the elegant
art which glided on the surface and refused to glance
at the often most inelegant motives of elegant acts—the art
which purposely ignored the often horrible consequences of
the so-called correct and elegant life. For Russia, this protest
was not necessary. Since Gógol, art could not be limited to
any class of society. It was bound to embody them all, to
treat them all realistically, and to penetrate beneath the surface
of social relations. Therefore there was no need of the
exaggeration which in France was a necessary and sound
reaction. There was no need, moreover, to fall into extremes
in order to free art from dull moralisation. Our great realist,
Gógol, had already shown to his followers how realism can
be put to the service of higher aims, without losing anything
of its penetration or ceasing to be a true reproduction of
life.</p>

I have a splendid time, and flirt awfully with both his wife

taking our meals where we could get them, without paying for them,

eaten his pastry to the account of the king of England?<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It
is quite different now. They all lend me money, as much as I care

<h3>TURGUÉNEFF</h3>

<p>Púshkin, Lérmontoff, and Gógol were the real
creators of Russian literature; but to Western Europe
they remained nearly total strangers. It was only
Turguéneff and Tolstóy—the two greatest novelists of
Russia, if not of their century altogether—and, to some
extent, Dostoyévskiy, who broke down the barrier of language
which had kept Russian writers unknown to West
Europeans. They have made Russian literature familiar and
popular outside Russia; they have exercised and still exercise
their share of influence upon West-European thought and
art; and owing to them, we may be sure that henceforward
the best productions of the Russian mind will be part of the
general intellectual belongings of civilised mankind.</p>

<p>For the artistic construction, the finish and the beauty of
his novels, Turguéneff was very probably the greatest novel-writer
of his century. However, the chief characteristic of
his poetical genius lay not only in that sense of the beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
which he possessed to so high a degree, but also in the
highly <i>intellectual</i> contents of his creations. His novels are
not mere stories dealing at random with this or that type of
men, or with some particular current of life, or accident
happening to fall under the author’s observation. They are
intimately connected with each other, and they give the succession
of the leading intellectual types of Russia which have
impressed their own stamp upon each successive generation.
The novels of Turguéneff, of which the first appeared in
1845, cover a period of more than thirty years, and during
these three decades Russian society underwent one of the
deepest and the most rapid modifications ever witnessed in
European history. The leading types of the educated classes
went through successive changes with a rapidity which was
only possible in a society suddenly awakening from a long
slumber, casting away an institution which hitherto had
permeated its whole existence (I mean serfdom), and rushing
towards a new life. And this succession of “history-making”
types was represented by Turguéneff with a depth
of conception, a fulness of philosophical and humanitarian
understanding, and an artistic insight, almost equal to foresight,
which are found in none of the modern writers to the
same extent and in that happy combination.</p>

<p>Not that he would follow a preconceived plan. “All these
discussions about ‘tendency’ and ‘unconsciousness’ in art,”
he wrote, “are nothing but a debased coin of rhetorics....
Those only who cannot do better will submit to a preconceived
programme, because a truly talented writer is the
condensed expression of life itself, and he cannot write either
a panegyric or a pamphlet: either would be too mean for
him.” But as soon as a new leading type of men or women
appeared amidst the educated classes of Russia, it took possession
of Turguéneff. He was haunted by it, and haunted
until he had succeeded in representing it to the best of his
understanding in a work of art, just as for years Murillo was
haunted by the image of a Virgin in the ecstasy of purest love,
until he finally succeeded in rendering on the canvas his full
conception.</p>

<p>When some human problem had thus taken possession of
Turguéneff’s mind, he evidently could not discuss it in terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
of logic—this would have been the manner of the political
writer—he conceived it in the shape of images and scenes.
Even in his conversation, when he intended to give you an
idea of some problem which worried his mind, he used to
do it by describing a scene so vividly that it would for
ever engrave itself in the memory. This was also a marked
trait in his writings. His novels are a succession of scenes—some
of them of the most exquisite beauty—each of
which helps him further to characterise his heroes. Therefore
all his novels are short, and need no plot to sustain the
reader’s attention. Those who have been perverted by sensational
novel-reading may, of course, be disappointed with a
want of sensational episode; but the ordinary intelligent
reader feels from the very first pages that he has <i>real</i> and
interesting men and women before him, with really human
hearts throbbing in them, and he cannot part with the book
before he has reached the end and grasped the characters in
full. Simplicity of means for accomplishing far-reaching ends—that
chief feature of truly good art—is felt in everything
Turguéneff wrote.</p>

<p>George Brandes, in his admirable study of Turguéneff (in
<i>Moderne Geister</i>), the best, the deepest, and the most
poetical of all that has been written about the great novelist,
makes the following remark:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is not easy to say quite definitely what makes of Turguéneff an
artist of the first rank.... That he has in the highest degree
the capacity which makes a true poet, of producing living human beings,
does not, after all, comprise everything. What makes the reader
feel so much his artistic superiority is the concordance one feels
between the interest taken by the poet in the person whom he depicts,
or the poet’s judgment about this person, and the impression which the
reader himself gets; because it is in this point—the relation of the
artist to his own creations—that every weakness of either the man or
the poet must necessarily appear.”</p>
</div>

<p>The reader feels every such mistake at once and keeps the
remembrance of it, notwithstanding all the efforts of the
author to dissipate its impression.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What reader of Balzac, or of Dickens, or of Auerbach—to
speak of the great dead only—does not know this feeling!” Brandes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
continues. “When Balzac swims in warmed-up excitement, or when
Dickens becomes childishly touching, and Auerbach intentionally
naïve, the reader feels repulsed by the untrue, the unpleasant. Never
do we meet with anything artistically repulsive in Turguéneff.”</p>
</div>

<p>This remark of the great critic is absolutely true, and only
a few words need be added to it, with reference to the
wonderful architecture of all Turguéneff’s novels. Be it a
small novel, or a large one, the proportion of the parts is
wonderfully held; not a single episode of a merely “ethnographical”
character comes in to disturb or to slacken the
development of the inner human drama; not one feature, and
certainly not one single scene, can be omitted without destroying
the impression of the whole; and the final accord,
which seals the usually touching general impression, is always
worked out with wonderful finish.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And then the beauty of the chief scenes. Every one of
them could be made the subject of a most artistic and telling
picture. Take, for instance, the final scenes of Helen
and Insároff in Venice: their visit to the picture gallery,
which made the keeper exclaim, as he looked at them,
<i>Poveretti!</i> or the scene in the theatre, where in response to
the imitated cough of the actress (who played Violetta in
<i>Traviata</i>) resounded the deep, real cough of the dying
Insároff. The actress herself, with her poor dress and bony
shoulders, who yet took possession of the audience by the
warmth and reality of her feeling, and created a storm of
enthusiasm by her cry of dying joy on the return of Alfred;
nay, I should even say, the dark harbour where one sees the
gull drop from rosy light into the deep blackness of the
night—each of these scenes comes to the imagination on
canvas. In his lecture, <i>Hamlet and Don Quixote</i>, where
he speaks of Shakespeare and Cervantes being contemporaries,
and mentions that the romance of Cervantes was
translated into English in Shakespeare’s lifetime, so that
he might have read it, Turguéneff exclaims: “What a
picture, worthy of the brush of a thoughtful painter: Shakespeare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
reading Don Quixote!” It would seem as if in these
lines he betrayed the secret of the wonderful beauty—the
pictorial beauty—of such a number of his scenes. He must
have imagined them, not only with the music of the feeling
that speaks in them, but also as <i>pictures</i>, full of the deepest
psychological meaning and in which all the surroundings of
the main figures—the Russian birch wood, or the German
town on the Rhine, or the harbour of Venice—are in harmony
with the feeling.</p>

<p>Turguéneff knew the human heart deeply, especially the
heart of a young, thoroughly honest, and reasoning girl when
she awakes to higher feelings and ideas, and that awakening
takes, without her realising it, the shape of love. In the
description of that moment of life Turguéneff stands quite
unrivalled. On the whole, love is the leading motive of all
his novels; and the moment of its full development is the
moment when his hero—he may be a political agitator or
a modest squire—appears in full light. The great poet knew
that a human type cannot be characterised by the daily work
in which such a man is engaged—however important that
work may be—and still less by a flow of words. Consequently,
when he draws, for instance, the picture of an
agitator in <i>Dmitri Rúdin</i>, he does not report his fiery
speeches—for the simple reason that the agitator’s words
would not have characterised him. Many have pronounced
the same appeals to Equality and Liberty before him, and
many more will pronounce them after his death. But that
special type of apostle of equality and liberty—the “man
of the word, and of no action” which he intended to
represent in Rúdin—is characterised by the hero’s relations
to different persons, and particularly, above all, by his love.
By his love—because it is in love that the human being
appears in full, with its individual features. Thousands of
men have made “propaganda by word,” all very much in
the same expressions, but each of them has loved in a different
way. Mazzini and Lassalle did similar work; but how
different they were in their loves! You do not know Lassalle
unless you know his relations to the Countess of Hatzfeld.</p>

<p>In common with all great writers, Turguéneff combined
the qualities of a pessimist and a lover of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There flows a deep and broad stream of melancholy in Turguéneff’s
mind,” remarks Brandes, “and therefore it flows also
through all his works. Though his description be objective and impersonal,
and although he hardly ever introduces into his novels lyric
poetry, nevertheless they produce on the whole the impression of lyrics.
There is so much of Turguéneff’s own personality expressed in them,
and this personality is always sadness—a specific sadness without a
touch of sentimentality. Never does Turguéneff give himself up
entirely to his feelings: he impresses by restraint; but no West European
novelist is so sad as he is. The great melancholists of the Latin
race, such as Leopardi and Flaubert, have hard, fast outlines in their
style; the German sadness is of a caustic humour, or it is pathetic, or
sentimental; but Turguéneff’s melancholy is, in its substance, the melancholy
of the Slavonian races in its weakness and tragical aspect, it is
a descendant in a straight line from the melancholy of the Slavonian
folk-song.... When Gógol is melancholy, it is from despair.
When Dostoyévskiy expresses the same feeling, it is because his heart
bleeds with sympathy for the down-trodden, and especially for great
sinners. Tolstóy’s melancholy has its foundation in his religious
fatalism. Turguéneff alone is a philosopher.... He loves man,
even though he does not think much of him and does not trust him
very much.”</p>
</div>

<p>The full force of Turguéneff’s talent appeared already in
his earlier productions—that is, in the series of short sketches
from village life, to which the misleading title of <i>A
Sportsman’s Note-Book</i> was given in order to avoid the
rigours of censorship. Notwithstanding the simplicity of their
contents and the total absence of the satirical element, these
sketches gave a decided blow to serfdom. Turguéneff did
not describe in them such atrocities of serfdom as might
have been considered mere exceptions to the rule; nor did
he idealise the Russian peasant; but by giving life-portraits
of sensible, reasoning, and loving beings, bent down under
the yoke of serfdom, together with life-pictures of the
shallowness and meanness of the life of the serf-owners—even
the best of them—he awakened the consciousness of
the wrong done by the system. The social influence of these
sketches was very great. As to their artistic qualities, suffice
it to say that in these short sketches we find in a few
pages most vivid pictures of an incredible variety of human
characters, together with most beautiful sketches of nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Contempt, admiration, sympathy, or deep sadness are impressed
in turns on the reader at the will of the young author—each
time, however, in such a form and by such vivid
scenes that each of these short sketches is worth a good
novel.</p>

<p>In the series of short novels, <i>A Quiet Corner</i>, <i>Correspondence</i>,
<i>Yákov Pásynkov</i>, <i>Faust</i>, and <i>Asya</i>, all dated 1854 and
1855, the genius of Turguéneff revealed itself fully: his
manner, his inner self, his powers. A deep sadness pervades
these novels. A sort of despair in the educated Russian,
who, even in his love, appears utterly incapable of a strong
feeling which would carry away all obstacles, and always
manages, even when circumstances favour him, to bring the
woman who loves him to grief and despair. The following
lines from <i>Correspondence</i> characterise best the leading
idea of three of these novels: <i>A Quiet Corner</i>, <i>Correspondence</i>,
and <i>Asya</i>. It is a girl of twenty-six who writes to a
friend of her childhood:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Again I repeat that I do not speak of the girl who finds it difficult
and hard to think.... She looks round, she expects, and
asks herself, when the one whom her soul is longing for will come....
At last he appears: she is carried away by him; she is like
soft wax in his hands. Happiness, love, thought—all these come now
in streams; all her unrest is settled, all doubts resolved by him;
truth itself seems to speak through his lips. She worships him, she
feels ashamed of her own happiness, she learns, she loves. Great is
his power over her at that time!... If he were a hero he could
have fired her, taught her how to sacrifice herself, and all sacrifices
would have been easy for her! But there are no heroes nowadays....
Still, he leads her wherever he likes; she takes to what
interests him; each of his words penetrates into her soul—she does
not know yet how insignificant and empty, how false, words can be,
how little they cost the one who pronounces them, how little they can
be trusted. Then, following these first moments of happiness and
hopes, comes usually—owing to circumstances (circumstances are
always the fault)—comes usually the separation. I have heard it
said that there have been cases when the two kindred souls have
united immediately; I have also heard that they did not always find
happiness in that ... however, I will not speak of what I have
not seen myself. But—the fact that calculation of the pettiest sort
and the most miserable prudence can live in a young heart by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
side of the most passionate exaltation, this I have unfortunately
learned from experience. So, the separation comes.... Happy
the girl who at once sees that this is the end of all, and will not
soothe herself by expectations! But you, brave and just men, you
mostly have not the courage, nor the desire, to tell us the truth ...
it is easier for you to deceive us ... or, after all, I am ready
to believe that, together with us, you deceive yourselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>A complete despair in the capacity for action of the
educated man in Russia runs through all the novels of this
period. Those few men who seem to be an exception—those
who have energy, or simulate it for a short time,
generally end their lives in the billiard room of the public
house, or spoil their existences in some other way. The years
1854 and 1855, when these novels were written, fully explain
the pessimism of Turguéneff. In Russia they were perhaps
the darkest years of that dark period of Russian history—the
reign of Nicholas I.—and in Western Europe, too, the
years closely following the <i>coup d’état</i> of Napoleon III.
were years of a general reaction after the great unrealised
hopes of 1848.</p>

<p>Turguéneff, who came very near being marched to Siberia
in 1852 for having printed at Moscow his innocent necrological
note about Gógol, after it had been forbidden by the St.
Petersburg censorship, was compelled to live now on his
estate, beholding round him the servile submissiveness of all
those who had formerly shown some signs of revolt. Seeing
all round the triumph of the supporters of serfdom and
despotism, he might easily have been brought to despair. But
the sadness which pervades the novels of this period was not
a cry of despair; it was not a satire either; it was the gentle
touch of a loving friend, and that constitutes their main
charm. From the artistic point of view, <i>Asya</i> and <i>Correspondence</i>
are perhaps the finest gems which we owe to
Turguéneff.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To judge of the importance of Turguéneff’s work one
must read in succession—so he himself desired—his six
novels: <i>Dmitri Rúdin</i>, <i>A Nobleman’s Retreat</i> (<i>Une nichée de
Gentilshommes</i>, or, <i>Liza</i>, in Mr. Ralston’s version), <i>On the
Eve</i>, <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, <i>Smoke</i>, and <i>Virgin Soil</i>. In them, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
sees his poetical powers in full; at the same time one gets an
insight into the different aspects which intellectual life took
in Russia from 1848 to 1876, and one understands the poet’s
attitude towards the best representatives of advanced thought
in Russia during that most interesting period of her development.
In some of his earlier short tales Turguéneff had already
touched upon Hamletism in Russian life. In his <i>Hamlet of
the Schigróvsky District</i>, and his <i>Diary of a Useless Man</i>, he
had already given admirable sketches of that sort of man.
But it was in <i>Rúdin</i> (1855) that he achieved the full artistic
representation of that type which had grown upon Russian
soil with especial profusion at a time when our best men
were condemned to inactivity and—words. Turguéneff did
not spare men of that type; he represented them with their
worst features, as well as with their best, and yet he treated
them with tenderness. He loved Rúdin, with all his defects,
and in this love he was at one with the best men of his generation,
and of ours, too.</p>

<p>Rúdin was a man of the “forties,” nurtured upon Hegel’s
philosophy, and developed under the conditions which prevailed
under Nicholas I., when there was no possibility whatever
for a thinking man to apply his energy, unless he chose
to become an obedient functionary of an autocratic, slave-owning
State. The scene is laid in one of the estates in
middle Russia, in the family of a lady who takes a superficial
interest in all sorts of novelties, reads books that are
prohibited by censorship, such as Tocqueville’s <i>Democracy
in America</i>; and must always have round her,
whether it be in her <i>salon</i> in the capital or on her estate, all
sorts of men of mark. It is in her drawing-room that Rúdin
makes his first appearance. In a few moments he becomes
master of the conversation, and by his intelligent remarks to
the point wins the admiration of the hostess and the sympathy
of the younger generation. The latter is represented
by the daughter of the lady and by a young student who is the
tutor of her boys. Both are entirely captivated by Rúdin.
When he speaks, later on in the evening, of his student years,
and touches upon such taking subjects as liberty, free thought,
and the struggles in Western Europe for freedom, his words
are full of so much fire, so much poetry and enthusiasm, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
the two younger people listen to him with a feeling which
approaches worship. The result is evident: Natásha, the
daughter, falls in love with him. Rúdin is much older than
Natásha—silver streaks already appear in his beautiful hair,
and he speaks of love as of something which, for him,
belongs to the past. “Look at this oak,” he says; “the last
autumn’s leaves still cover it, and they will never fall off until
the young green leaves have made their appearance.”
Natásha understands this in the sense that Rúdin’s old love
can only fade away when a new one has taken its place—and
gives him her love. Breaking with all the traditions of
the strictly correct house of her mother, she gives an interview
to Rúdin in the early morning on the banks of a remote
pond. She is ready to follow him anywhere, anyhow, without
making any conditions; but he, whose love is more in his
brain than in his heart, finds nothing to say to her but to talk
about the impossibility of obtaining the permission of her
mother for this marriage. Natásha hardly listens to his
words. She would follow him with or without the consent of
her mother, and asks: “What is then to be done?”—“To
submit,” is Rúdin’s reply.</p>

<p>The hero who spoke so beautifully about fighting against
all possible obstacles has broken down before the first obstacle
that appeared in his way. Words, words, and no actions,
was indeed the characteristic of these men, who in the forties
represented the best thinking element of Russian society.</p>

<p>Later on we meet Rúdin once more. He has still found no
work for himself, neither has he made peace with the conditions
of life at that time. He remains poor, exiled by the
government from one town to another, till at last he goes
abroad, and during the insurrection of June, 1848, he is
killed on a barricade in Paris. There is an epilogue to the
novel, and that epilogue is so beautiful that a few passages
from it must be produced here. It is Lézhneff, formerly
Rúdin’s enemy, who speaks.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know him well,” continued Lézhneff, “I am aware of his
faults. They are the more conspicuous because he is not to be regarded
on a small scale.”</p>

<p>“His is a character of genius!” cried Bassístoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Genius, very likely he has!” replied Lézhneff, “but as for character....
That’s just his misfortune: there’s no force of
character in him.... But I want to speak of what is good,
of what is rare in him. He has enthusiasm; and, believe me, who
am a phlegmatic person enough, that is the most precious quality
in our times. We have all become insufferably reasonable, indifferent,
and slothful; we are asleep and cold, and thanks to anyone
who will wake us up and warm us! It is high time! Do you
remember, Sásha, once when I was talking to you about him, I
blamed him for coldness? I was right, and wrong too, then. The
coldness is in his blood—that is not his fault—and not in his head. He
is not an actor, as I called him, nor a cheat, nor a scoundrel; he
lives at other people’s expense, not like a swindler, but like a child....
Yes; no doubt he will die somewhere in poverty and want;
but are we to throw stones at him for that? He never does anything
himself precisely, he has no vital force, no blood; but who has the
right to say that he has not been of use, that his words have not
scattered good seeds in young hearts, to whom nature has not denied,
as she has to him, powers for action, and the faculty of carrying
out their own ideas? Indeed, I myself, to begin with, have gained
all that I have from him. Sásha knows what Rúdin did for me in
my youth. I also maintained, I recollect, that Rúdin’s words could
not produce an effect on men; but I was speaking then of men like
myself, at my present age, of men who have already lived and been
broken in by life. One false note in a man’s eloquence, and the whole
harmony is spoiled for us; but a young man’s ear, happily, is not
so over-fine, not so trained. If the substance of what he hears seems
fine to him, what does he care about the intonation? The intonation
he will supply for himself!”</p>

<p>“Bravo, bravo!” cried Bassístoff, “that is justly spoken! And as
regards Rúdin’s influence, I swear to you, that man not only knows
how to move you, he lifts you up, he does not let you stand still,
he stirs you to the depths and sets you on fire!”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
</div>

<p>However, with such men as Rúdin further progress in
Russia would have been impossible: new men had to appear.
And so they did: we find them in the subsequent novels of
Turguéneff—but they meet with what difficulties, what pains
they undergo! This we see in Lavrétskiy and Líza (<i>A Nobleman’s
Retreat</i>) who belonged to the intermediate period.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Lavrétskiy could not be satisfied with Rúdin’s rôle of an
errant apostle; he tried his hands at practical activity; but he
also could not find his way amidst the new currents of life.
He had the same artistic and philosophical development as
Rúdin; he had the necessary will; but his powers of action
were palsied—not by his power of analysis in this case, but
by the mediocrity of his surroundings and by his unfortunate
marriage. Lavrétskiy ends also in wreck.</p>

<p><i>A Nobleman’s Retreat</i> was an immense success. It was said
that, together with the autobiographic tale, <i>First Love</i>, it
was the most artistic of Turguéneff’s works. This, however, is
hardly so. Its great success was surely due, first of all, to the
wide circle of readers to whom it appealed. Lavrétskiy has
married most unfortunately—a lady who soon becomes a sort
of a second-rate Parisian lioness. They separate; and then
he meets with a girl, Líza, in whom Turguéneff has given the
best impersonation imaginable of the average, thoroughly
good and honest Russian girl of those times. She and Lavrétskiy
fall in love with each other. For a moment both she
and Lavrétskiy think that the latter’s wife is dead—so it
stood, at least, in a Paris <i>feuilleton</i>; but the lady reappears
bringing with her all her abominable atmosphere, and Líza
goes to a convent. Unlike Rúdin or Bazároff, all the persons
of this drama, as well as the drama itself, are quite familiar
to the average reader, and for merely that reason the
novel appealed to an extremely wide circle of sympathisers.
Of course, the artistic powers of Turguéneff appear with
a wonderful force in the representation of such types as
Líza and Lavrétskiy’s wife, Líza’s old aunt, and Lavrétskiy
himself. The note of poetry and sadness which pervades the
novel carries away the reader completely. And yet, I may
venture to say, the following novel, <i>On the Eve</i>, far superseded
the former both in the depth of its conception and the
beauty of its workmanship.</p>

<p>Already, in Natásha, Turguéneff had given a life-picture
of a Russian girl who has grown up in the quietness of village
life, but has in her heart, and mind, and will the germs of
that which moves human beings to higher action. Rúdin’s
spirited words, his appeals to what is grand and worth living
for, inflamed her. She was ready to follow him, to support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
him in the great work which he so eagerly and uselessly
searched for, but it was he who proved to be her inferior.
Turguéneff thus foresaw, since 1855, the coming of that type
of woman who later on played so prominent a part in the
revival of Young Russia. Four years later, in <i>On the Eve</i>,
he gave, in Helen, a further and fuller development of the
same type. Helen is not satisfied with the dull, trifling life in
her own family, and she longs for a wider sphere of action.
“To be good is not enough; to do good—yes; that is the
great thing in life,” she writes in her diary. But whom does
she meet in her surroundings? Shúbin, a talented artist, a
spoiled child, “a butterfly which admires itself”; Berséneff,
a future professor, a true Russian nature—an excellent man,
most unselfish and modest, but wanting inspiration, totally
lacking in vigour and initiative. These two are the best. There
is a moment when Shúbin, as he rambles on a summer night
with his friend Berséneff, says to him: “I love Helen, but
Helen loves you.... Sing, sing louder, if you can; and if
you cannot, then take off your hat, look above, and smile
to the stars. They all look upon you, upon you alone: they
always look on those who are in love.” But Berséneff returns
to his small room, and—opens Raumer’s “History of the
Hohenstauffens,” on the same page where he had left it the
last time....</p>

<p>Thereupon comes Insároff, a Bulgarian patriot, entirely
absorbed by <i>one</i> idea—the liberation of his mother-country;
a man of steel, rude to the touch, who has cast away all
melancholy philosophical dreaming, and marches straight
forward, towards the aim of his life—and the choice of
Helen is settled. The pages given to the awakening of her
feeling and to its growth are among the best ever written by
Turguéneff. When Insároff suddenly becomes aware of his
own love for Helen, his first decision is to leave at once the
suburb of Moscow, where they are all staying, and Russia as
well. He goes to Helen’s house to announce there his departure.
Helen asks him to promise that he will see her again
to-morrow before he leaves, but he does not promise. Helen
waits for him, and when he has not come in the afternoon,
she herself goes to him. Rain and thunder overtake her on
the road, and she steps into an old chapel by the roadside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
There she meets Insároff, and the explanation between the
shy, modest girl who perceives that Insároff loves her, and
the patriot, who discovers in her the force which, far from
standing in his way, would only double his own energy,
terminates by Insároff exclaiming: “Well, then, welcome,
my wife before God and men!”</p>

<p>In Helen we have the true type of that Russian woman
who a few years later joined heart and soul in all movements
for Russian freedom: the woman who conquered her right
to knowledge, totally reformed the education of children,
fought for the liberation of the toiling masses, endured unbroken
in the snows and gaols of Siberia, died if necessary on
the scaffold, and at the present moment continues with unabated
energy the same struggle. The high artistic beauty of
this novel has already been incidentally mentioned. Only one
reproach can be made to it: the hero, Insároff, the man of
action, is not sufficiently living. But both for the general
architecture of the novel and the beauty of its separate
scenes, beginning with the very first and ending with the last,
<i>On the Eve</i> stands among the highest productions of the sort
in all literatures.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next novel of Turguéneff was <i>Fathers and Sons</i>. It
was written in 1859 when, instead of the sentimentalists and
“æsthetical” people of old, quite a new type of man was
making its appearance in the educated portion of Russian
society—the nihilist. Those who have not read Turguéneff’s
works will perhaps associate the word “nihilist” with the
struggle which took place in Russia in 1879-1881 between
the autocratic power and the terrorists; but this would be a
great mistake. “Nihilism” is not “terrorism,” and the type
of the nihilist is infinitely deeper and wider than that of a
terrorist. Turguéneff’s <i>Fathers and Sons</i> must be read in
order to understand it. The representative of this type in the
novel is a young doctor, Bazároff—“a man who bows before
no authority, however venerated it may be, and accepts of no
principle unproved.” Consequently he takes a negative attitude
towards all the institutions of the present time and he
throws overboard all the conventionalities and the petty lies
of ordinary society life. He comes on a visit to his old parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and stays also at the country house of a young friend of his,
whose father and uncle are two typical representatives of the
old generation. This gives to Turguéneff the possibility of
illustrating in a series of masterly scenes the conflict between
the two generations—“the fathers” and “the sons.” That
conflict was going on in those years with bitter acrimony all
over Russia.</p>

<p>One of the two brothers, Nikolái Petróvitch, is an excellent,
slightly enthusiastic dreamer who in his youth was fond
of Schiller and Púshkin, but never took great interest in
practical matters; he now lives, on his estate, the lazy life of
a landowner. He would like, however, to show to the young
people that he, too, can go a long way with them: he tries to
read the materialistic books which his son and Bazároff read,
and even to speak their language; but his entire education
stands in the way of a true “realistic” comprehension of the
real state of affairs.</p>

<p>The elder brother, Peter Petróvitch, is, on the contrary, a
direct descendant from Lérmontoff’s Petchórin—that is, a
thorough, well-bred egotist. Having spent his youth in
high society circles, he, even now in the dulness of the small
country estate, considers it as a “duty” to be always properly
dressed “as a perfect gentleman,” strictly to obey the
rules of “Society,” to remain faithful to Church and State,
and never to abandon his attitude of extreme reserve—which
he abandons, however, every time that he enters into a discussion
about “principles” with Bazároff. The “nihilist”
inspires him with hatred.</p>

<p>The nihilist is, of course, the out-and-out negation of all
the “principles” of Peter Petróvitch. He does not believe
in the established principles of Church and State, and openly
professes a profound contempt for all the established forms
of society-life. He does not see that the wearing of a clean
collar and a perfect necktie should be described as the performance
of a duty. When he speaks, he says what he
thinks. Absolute sincerity—not only in what he says, but
also towards himself—and a common sense standard of
judgments, without the old prejudices, are the ruling features
of his character. This leads, evidently, to a certain assumed
roughness of expression, and the conflict between the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
generations must necessarily take a tragical aspect. So it
was everywhere in Russia at that time. The novel expressed
the real tendency of the time and accentuated it, so that—as
has been remarked by a gifted Russian critic, S. Venguéroff—the
novel and the reality mutually influenced each other.</p>

<p><i>Fathers and Sons</i> produced a tremendous impression.
Turguéneff was assailed on all sides: by the old generation,
which reproached him with being “a nihilist himself”; and
by the youth, which was discontented at being identified with
Bazároff. The truth is that, with a very few exceptions,
among whom was the great critic, Písareff, we do not properly
understand Bazároff. Turguéneff had so much accustomed
us to a certain poetical halo which surrounded his
heroes, and to his own tender love which followed them, even
when he condemned them, that finding nothing of the sort in
his attitude towards Bazároff, we saw in the absence of these
features a decided hostility of the author towards the hero.
Moreover, certain features of Bazároff decidedly displeased
us. Why should a man of his powers display such a harshness
towards his old parents: his loving mother and his
father—the poor old village-doctor who has retained, to
old age, faith in his science. Why should Bazároff fall in
love with that most uninteresting, self-admiring lady,
Madame Odintsóff, and fail to be loved, even by her? And
then why, at a time when in the young generation the seeds of
a great movement towards freeing the masses were already
ripening, why make Bazároff say that he is ready to work for
the peasant, but if somebody comes and says to him that he
is bound to do so, he will hate that peasant? To which Bazároff
adds, in a moment of reflection: “And what of that?
Grass will grow out of me when this peasant acquires well-being!”
We did not understand this attitude of Turguéneff’s
nihilist, and it was only on re-reading <i>Fathers and Sons</i> much
later on, that we noticed, in the very words that so offended
us, the germs of a realistic philosophy of solidarity and duty
which only now begins to take a more or less definite shape.
In 1860 we, the young generation, looked on it as Turguéneff’s
desire to throw a stone at a new type with which he did
not sympathise.</p>

<p>And yet, as Písareff understood at once, Bazároff <i>was</i> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
real representative of the young generation. Turguéneff, as
he himself wrote later on, merely did not “add syrup” to
make his hero appear somewhat sweeter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bazároff,” he wrote, “puts all the other personalities of my
novel in the shade. He is honest, straightforward, and a democrat
of the purest water, and you find no good qualities in him! The duel
with Petr Petróvitch is only introduced to show the intellectual
emptiness of the elegant, noble knighthood; in fact, I even exaggerated
and made it ridiculous. My conception of Bazároff is such as
to make him appear throughout much superior to Petr Petróvitch.
Nevertheless, when he calls himself nihilist you must read <i>revolutionist</i>.
To draw on one side a functionary who takes bribes, and on
the other an ideal youth—I leave it to others to make such pictures.
My aim was much higher than that. I conclude with one remark: If
the reader is not won by Bazároff, notwithstanding his roughness,
absence of heart, pitiless dryness and terseness, then the fault is with
me—I have missed my aim; but to sweeten him with syrup (to use
Bazároff’s own language), this I did not want to do, although perhaps
through that I would have won Russian youth at once to my
side.”</p>
</div>

<p>The true key to the understanding of <i>Fathers and Sons</i>,
and, in fact, of whatever Turguéneff wrote, is given, I will
permit myself to suggest, in his admirable lecture, <i>Hamlet
and Don Quixote</i> (1860). I have already elsewhere intimated
this; but I am bound to repeat it here, as I think that,
better than any other of Turguéneff’s writings, this lecture
enables us to look into the very philosophy of the great
novelist. Hamlet and Don Quixote—Turguéneff wrote—personify
the two opposite particularities of human nature. All
men belong more or less to the one or to the other of these
two types. And, with his wonderful powers of analysis, he
thus characterised the two heroes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Don Quixote is imbued with devotion towards his ideal, for
which he is ready to suffer all possible privations, to sacrifice his life;
life itself he values only so far as it can serve for the incarnation
of the ideal, for the promotion of truth, of justice on Earth....
He lives for his brothers, for opposing the forces hostile to mankind:
the witches, the giants—that is, the oppressors.... Therefore
he is fearless, patient; he is satisfied with the most modest food, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
poorest cloth: he has other things to think of. Humble in his heart,
he is great and daring in his mind.” ... “And who is Hamlet?
Analysis, first of all, and egotism, and therefore no faith. He lives
entirely for himself, he is an egotist; but to believe in one’s self—even
an egotist cannot do that: we can believe only in something which is
outside us and above us.... As he has doubts of everything, Hamlet
evidently does not spare himself; his intellect is too developed to remain
satisfied with what he finds in himself: he feels his weakness,
but each self-consciousness is a force wherefrom results his irony,
the opposite of the enthusiasm of Don Quixote.” ... “Don
Quixote, a poor man, almost a beggar, without means and relations,
old, isolated—undertakes to redress all the evils and to protect oppressed
strangers over the whole earth. What does it matter to him that
his first attempt at freeing the innocent from his oppressor falls twice
as heavy upon the head of the innocent himself?... What does
it matter that, thinking that he has to deal with noxious giants, Don
Quixote attacks useful windmills?... Nothing of the sort can
ever happen with Hamlet: how could he, with his perspicacious, refined,
sceptical mind, ever commit such a mistake! No, he will not
fight with windmills, he does not believe in giants ... but he
would not have attacked them even if they did exist.... And
yet, although Hamlet is a sceptic, although he disbelieves in good,
he does not believe in evil. Evil and deceit are his inveterate enemies.
His scepticism is not indifferentism.” ... “But in negation, as
in fire, there is a destructive power, and how to keep it in bounds,
how to tell it where to stop, when that which it must destroy, and
that which it must spare are often inseparably welded together?
Here it is that the often-noticed tragical aspect of human life comes
in: for action we require will, and for action we require thought;
but thought and will have parted from each other, and separate
every day more and more....</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This lecture fully explains, I believe, the attitude of Turguéneff
towards Bazároff. He himself belonged to a great
extent to the Hamlets. Among them he had his best friends.
He loved Hamlet; yet he admired Don Quixote—the man
of action. He felt his superiority; but, while describing this
second type of men, he never could surround it with that
tender poetical love for a sick friend which makes the irresistible
attraction of those of his novels which deal with one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
or other of the Hamlet type. He admired Bazároff—his
roughness as well as his power; Bazároff overpowered him;
but he could by no means have for him the tender feelings
which he had had for men of his own generation and his
own refinement. In fact, with Bazároff they would have been
out of place.</p>

<p>This we did not notice at that time, and therefore we did
not understand Turguéneff’s intention of representing the
<i>tragic</i> position of Bazároff amidst his surroundings. “I
entirely share Bazároff’s ideas,” he wrote later on. “All of
them, with the exception of his negation of art.” “I <i>loved</i>
Bazároff; I will prove it to you by my diary,” he told me once
in Paris. Certainly he loved him—but with an intellectually
admiring love, quite different from the compassionate love
which he had bestowed upon Rúdin and Lavrétskiy. This difference
escaped us, and was the chief cause of the misunderstanding
which was so painful for the great poet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Turguéneff’s next novel, <i>Smoke</i> (1867), need not be dwelt
upon. One object he had in it was to represent the powerful
type of a Russian society lioness, which had haunted him for
years, and to which he returned several times, until he finally
succeeded in finding for it, in <i>Spring Flood</i>, the fullest and
the most perfect artistic expression. His other object was to
picture in its true colours the shallowness—nay, the silliness,
of that society of bureaucrats into whose hands Russia fell
for the next twenty years. Deep despair in the future of
Russia after the wreck of that great reform movement which
had given to us the abolition of serfdom pervades the novel;
a despair which can by no means be attributed entirely, or
even chiefly, to the hostile reception of <i>Fathers and Sons</i> by
the Russian youth, but must be sought for in the wreck of the
great hopes which Turguéneff and his best friends had laid in
the representatives of the reform movement of 1859-1863.
This same despair made Turguéneff write “<i>Enough; from
the Memoirs of a Dead Artist</i>” (1865), and the fantastic
sketch, “<i>Ghosts</i>” (1867), and he recovered from it only
when he saw the birth in Russia of a new movement,
“towards the people!” which took place amongst our youth
in the early seventies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>This movement he represented in his last novel of the above-mentioned
series, <i>Virgin Soil</i> (1876). That he was fully sympathetic
with it is self-evident; but the question, whether his novel gives a
correct idea of the movement, must be answered to some extent in the
negative—even though Turguéneff had, with his wonderful intuition,
caught some of the most striking features of the movement. The novel
was finished in 1876 (we read it, in a full set of proofs, at the
house of P. L. Lavróff, in London, in the autumn of that year)—that
means, two years before the great trial of those who were arrested
for this agitation took place. And in 1876 no one could possibly have
known the youth of our circles unless he had himself belonged to
them. Consequently, <i>Virgin Soil</i> could only refer to the very
beginnings of the movement. Besides, Turguéneff did not meet with any
of the best representatives of it. Much of the novel is true, but the
general impression it conveys is not precisely the impression which
Turguéneff himself would have received if he had better known the
Russian youth at that time.</p>

<p>With all the force of his immense talent, he could not
supply by intuition the lack of knowledge. And yet he understood
two characteristic features of the earliest part of the
movement: misconception of the peasantry, the peculiar incapacity
of most of the early promoters of the movement
to understand the Russian peasant, on account of the bias
of their false literary, historical, and social education; and
the Hamletism: the want of resolution, or rather “resolution
sicklied o’er by the pale cast of thought,” which really
characterised the movement at its outset. If Turguéneff had
lived a few years more he surely would have noticed coming
into the arena the new type of men of action—the new modification
of Insároff’s and Bazároff’s type, which grew up in
proportion as the movement was taking firm root. He had
already perceived them through the dryness of official records
of the trial of “the hundred-and-ninety three,” and in 1878
he asked me to tell him all I knew about Mýshkin, one of the
most powerful individualities of that trial.</p>

<p>He did not live to accomplish this. A disease which nobody
understood and was mistaken for “gout,” but which was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
reality a cancer of the spinal cord, kept him for the last few
years of his life an invalid, rivetted to his couch. Only his
letters, full of thought and life, where sadness and merriment
go on in turn, are what remains from his pen during that
period of life, when he seems to have meditated upon several
novels which he left unfinished or perhaps unwritten. He died
at Paris in 1883 at the age of sixty-five.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a few words, at least, must be said about
his “<i>Verse in Prose</i>,” or “<i>Senilia</i>” (1882). These are
“flying remarks, thoughts, images,” which he wrote down
from 1878 onwards under the impression of this or that fact
of his own personal life, or of public life. Though written in
prose, they are true pieces of excellent poetry, some of them
real gems; some deeply touching and as impressive as the
best verses of the best poets (<i>Old Woman</i>; <i>The Beggar</i>;
<i>Másha</i>; <i>How Beautiful, how Fresh were the Roses</i>); while
others (<i>Nature</i>, <i>The Dog</i>) are more characteristic of
Turguéneff’s philosophical conceptions than anything else
he has written. And finally, in <i>On the Threshold</i>, written a
few months before his death, he expressed in most poetical
accents his admiration of those women who gave their lives
for the revolutionary movement and went on the scaffold,
without being even understood at the time by those for whom
they died.</p>

<h3>TOLSTÓY—CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD</h3>

<p>More than half a century ago, <i>i. e.</i> in 1852, the first story
of Tolstóy, <i>Childhood</i>, soon followed by <i>Boyhood</i>, made its
appearance in the monthly review, <i>The Contemporary</i>, with
the modest signature, “L. N. T.” The little story was a
great success. It was imbued with such a charm; it had such
freshness, and was so free of all the mannerism of the literary
trade, that the unknown author at once became a favourite,
and was placed by the side of Turguéneff and Gontcharóff.</p>

<p>There are excellent children’s stories in all languages. Childhood
is the period of life with which many authors have best
succeeded in dealing. And yet no one, perhaps, has so well
described the life of children from within, from their own
point of view, as Tolstóy did. With him, it is the child itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
which expresses its childish feelings, and it does this so as to
compel the reader to judge full-grown people with the child’s
point of view. Such is the realism of <i>Childhood</i> and <i>Boyhood</i>—that
is, their richness in facts caught from real life—that
a Russian critic, Písareff, developed quite a theory of
education chiefly on the basis of the data contained in these
two stories of Tolstóy’s.</p>

<p>It is related somewhere that one day, during their rambles
in the country, Turguéneff and Tolstóy came across an old
hack of a horse which was finishing its days in a lonely field.
Tolstóy entered at once into the feelings of the horse and
began to describe its sad reflections so vividly, that Turguéneff,
alluding to the then new ideas of Darwinism, could
not help exclaiming, “I am sure, Lyov Nikoláevitch, that
you <i>must</i> have had horses among your ancestors!” In the
capacity of entirely identifying himself with the feelings and
the thoughts of the beings of whom he speaks, Tolstóy has
but few rivals; but with children this power of identification
attains its highest degree. The moment he speaks of children,
Tolstóy becomes himself a child.</p>

<p><i>Childhood</i> and <i>Boyhood</i> are, it is now known, autobiographical
stories, in which only small details are altered, and
in the boy Irténeff we have a glimpse of what L. N. Tolstóy
was in his childhood. He was born in 1828, in the estate of
Yásnaya Polyána, which now enjoys universal fame, and for
the first fifteen years of his life he remained, almost without
interruption, an inhabitant of the country. His father and
grandfather—so we are told by the Russian critic, S. Venguéroff—are
described in <i>War and Peace</i>, in Nicholas Róstoff
and the old Count Róstoff respectively; while his mother,
who was born a Princess Volkhónskaya, is represented as
Mary Bolkónskaya. Leo Tolstóy lost his mother at the age
of two, and his father at the age of nine, and after that time
his education was taken care of by a woman relative, T. A.
Ergólskaya, in Yásnaya Polyána, and after 1840, at Kazáñ,
by his aunt P. I. Yúshkova, whose house, we are told, must
have been very much the same as the house of the Róstoffs
in <i>War and Peace</i>.</p>

<p>Leo Tolstóy was only fifteen when he entered the Kazáñ
University, where he spent two years in the Oriental faculty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and two years in the faculty of Law. However, the teaching-staff
of both faculties was so feeble at that time that only a
single professor was able to awaken in the young man some
passing interest in his subject. Four years later, that is in
1847, when he was only nineteen, Leo Tolstóy had already
left the University and was making at Yásnaya Polyána some
attempts at improving the conditions of his peasant serfs, of
which attempts he has told us later on, with such a striking
sincerity, in <i>The Morning of a Landlord</i>.</p>

<p>The next four years of his life he spent, externally, like
most young men of his aristocratic circle, but internally, in a
continual reaction against the life he was leading. An insight
into what he was then—slightly exaggerated, of course, and
dramatised—we can get from the <i>Notes of a Billiard
Marker</i>. Happily he could not put up with such paltry surroundings
and in 1851, he suddenly renounced the life he
had hitherto led—that of an idle aristocratic youth—and
following his brother Nicholas, he went to the Caucasus, in
order to enter military service. There he stayed first at
Pyatigórsk—the place so full of reminiscences of Lérmontoff—until,
having passed the necessary examinations, he
was received as a non-commissioned officer (<i>yunker</i>) in the
artillery and went to serve in a Cossack village on the banks
of the Térek.</p>

<p>His experiences and reflections in these new surroundings,
we know from his <i>Cossacks</i>. But it was there also that in the
face of the beautiful nature which had so powerfully inspired
Púshkin and Lérmontoff he found his true vocation. He
sent to the <i>Contemporary</i> his first literary experiment,
<i>Childhood</i>, and this first story, as he soon learned from a
letter of the poet Nekrásoff, editor of the review, and from
the critical notes of Grigórieff, Annenkoff, Druzhínin, and
Tchernyshévskiy (they belonged to four different æsthetical
schools), proved to be a <i>chef d’œuvre</i>.</p>

<h3>DURING AND AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR</h3>

<p>However, the great Crimean war began towards the end
of the next year (1853), and L. N. Tolstóy did not want to
remain inactive in the Caucasus army. He obtained his transfer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
to the Danube army, took part in the siege of Silistria,
and later on in the battle of Balakláva, and from November,
1854, till August, 1855, remained besieged in Sebastopol—partly
in the terrible “Fourth bastion,” where he lived
through all the dreadful experiences of the heroic defenders
of that fortress. He has therefore the right to speak of War:
he knows it from within. He knows what it is, even under its
very best aspects, in such a significant and inspired phase as
was the defence of these forts and bastions which had grown
up under the enemy’s shells. He obstinately refused during
the siege to become an officer of the Staff, and remained with
his battery in the most dangerous spots.</p>

<p>I perfectly well remember, although I was only twelve
or thirteen, the profound impression which his sketch, <i>Sebastopol
in December, 1854</i>, followed, after the fall of the fortress,
by two more Sebastopol sketches—produced in Russia.
The very character of these sketches was original. They were
not leaves from a diary, and yet they were as true to reality
as such leaves could be; in fact, even more true, because they
were not representing one corner only of real life—the
corner which accidentally fell under the writer’s observations—but
the whole life, the prevailing modes of thought
and the habits of life in the besieged fortress. They represented—and
this is characteristic of all subsequent works of
Tolstóy—an interweaving of <i>Dichtung</i> and <i>Wahrheit</i>, of
poetry and truth, truth and poetry, containing much more
truth than is usually found in a novel, and more poetry, more
poetical creation, than occurs in most works of pure fiction.</p>

<p>Tolstóy apparently never wrote in verse; but during the
siege of Sebastopol he composed, in the usual metre and
language of soldiers’ songs, a satirical song in which he
described the blunders of the commanders which ended in
the Balakláva disaster. The song, written in an admirable
popular style, could not be printed, but it spread over Russia
in thousands of copies and was widely sung, both during
and immediately after the campaign. The name of the author
also leaked out, but there was some uncertainty as to whether
it was the author of the Sebastopol sketches or some other
Tolstóy.</p>

<p>On his return from Sebastopol and the conclusion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
peace (1856) Tolstóy stayed partly at St. Petersburg and
partly at Yásnaya Polyána. In the capital he was received
with open arms by all classes of society, both literary and
worldly, as a “Sebastopol hero” and as a rising great
writer. But of the life he lived then he cannot speak now
otherwise than with disgust: it was the life of hundreds of
young men—officers of the Guard and <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of his
own class—which was passed in the restaurants and <i>cafés
chantants</i> of the Russian capital, amidst gamblers, horse
dealers, Tsigane choirs, and French adventuresses. He became
at that time friendly with Turguéneff and saw much of
him, both at St. Petersburg and at Yásnaya Polyána—the
estates of the two great writers being not very far from each
other; but, although his friend Turguéneff was taking then a
lively part in co-editing with Hérzen the famous revolutionary
paper, <i>The Bell</i> (see Chapter VIII.), Tolstóy, seems to
have taken no interest in it; and while he was well acquainted
with the editing staff of the then famous review, <i>The Contemporary</i>,
which was fighting the good fight for the liberation
of the peasants and for freedom in general, Tolstóy, for
one reason or another, never became friendly with the Radical
leaders of that review—Tchernyshévskiy, Dobrolúboff, Mikháiloff,
and their friends.</p>

<p>Altogether, the great intellectual and reform movement
which was going on then in Russia seems to have left him
cold. He did not join the party of reforms. Still less was he
inclined to join those young Nihilists whom Turguéneff had
portrayed to the best of his ability in <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, or
later on in the seventies, the youth whose watchword became:
“Be the people,” and with whom Tolstóy has so much
in common at the present time. What was the reason of that
estrangement we are unable to say. Was it that a deep
chasm separated the young epicuræan aristocrat from the
ultra-democratic writers, like Dobrolúboff, who worked at
spreading socialistic and democratic ideas in Russia, and still
more from those who, like Rakhmétoff in Tchernyshévskiy’s
novel <i>What is to be done</i>, lived the life of the peasant, thus
practising then what Tolstóy began to preach twenty years
later?</p>

<p>Or, was it the difference between the two generations—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
man of thirty or more, which Tolstóy was, and the
young people in their early twenties, possessed of all the
haughty intolerance of youth,—which kept them aloof from
each other. And was it not, in addition to all this, the result of
theories? namely, a fundamental difference in the conceptions
of the advanced Russian Radicals, who at that time were
mostly admirers of Governmental Jacobinism, and the
Populist, the No-Government man which Tolstóy must have
already then been, since it distinctly appeared in his negative
attitude towards Western civilisation, and especially in the
educational work which he began in 1861 in the Yásnaya
Polyána school?</p>

<p>The novels which Tolstóy brought out during these years,
1856-1862, do not throw much light upon his state of mind,
because, even though they are to a great extent autobiographical,
they mostly relate to earlier periods of his life.
Thus, he published two more of his Sebastopol war-sketches.
All his powers of observation and war-psychology, all his
deep comprehension of the Russian soldier, and especially of
the plain, un-theatrical hero who really wins the battles, and
a profound understanding of that inner spirit of an army
upon which depend success and failure: everything, in short,
which developed into the beauty and the truthfulness of <i>War
and Peace</i> was already manifested in these sketches, which
undoubtedly represented a new departure in war-literature
the world over.</p>

<h3>YOUTH: IN SEARCH OF AN IDEAL</h3>

<p><i>Youth</i>, <i>The Morning of a Landed Proprietor</i>, and <i>Lucerne</i>
appeared during the same years, but they produced
upon us readers, as well as upon the literary critics, a strange
and rather unfavourable impression. The great writer remained;
and his talent was showing evident signs of growth,
while the problems of life which he touched upon were deepening
and widening; but the heroes who seemed to represent
the ideas of the author himself could not entirely win our
sympathies. In <i>Childhood</i> and <i>Boyhood</i> we had had before
us the boy Irténeff. Now, in <i>Youth</i>, Irténeff makes the acquaintance
of Prince Neklúdoff; they become great friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and promise, without the slightest reservation, to confess to
each other their moral failings. Of course, they do not
always keep this promise; but it leads them to continual self-probing,
to a repentance one moment which is forgotten the
next, and to an unavoidable duality of mind which has the
most debilitating effect upon the two young men’s character.
The ill results of these moral endeavours Tolstóy did not
conceal. He detailed them with the greatest imaginable sincerity,
but he seemed nevertheless to keep them before his
readers as something desirable; and with this we could not
agree.</p>

<p>Youth is certainly the age when higher moral ideals find
their way into the mind of the future man or woman; the
years when one strives to get rid of the imperfections of boyhood
or girlhood; but this aim is never attained in the
ways recommended at monasteries and Jesuit schools. The
only proper way is to open before the young mind new,
broad horizons; to free it from superstitions and fears; to
grasp man’s position amidst Nature and Mankind; and
especially to feel at one with some great cause and to nurture
one’s forces with the view of being able some day to struggle
for that cause. Idealism—that is, the capacity of conceiving
a poetical love towards something great, and to prepare for
it—is the only sure preservation from all that destroys the
vital forces of man: vice, dissipation, and so on. This inspiration,
this love of an ideal, the Russian youth used to find in
the student circles, of which Turguéneff has left us such
spirited descriptions. Instead of that, Irténeff and Neklúdoff,
remaining during their university years in their splendid
aristocratic isolation, are unable to conceive a higher ideal
worth living for, and spent their forces in vain endeavours of
semi-religious moral improvement, on a plan that may perhaps
succeed in the isolation of a monastery, but usually ends
in failure amidst the attractions lying round a young man
of the world. These failures Tolstóy relates, as usual, with
absolute earnestness and sincerity.</p>

<p><i>The Morning of a Landed Proprietor</i> produced again a
strange impression. The story deals with the unsuccessful
philanthropic endeavours of a serf-owner who tries to make
his serfs happy and wealthy—without ever thinking of beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
where he ought to begin: namely, of setting his slaves
free. In those years of liberation of the serfs and enthusiastic
hopes, such a story sounded as an anachronism—the more
so as it was not known at the time of its appearance that it
was a page from Tolstóy’s earlier autobiography relating to
the year 1847, when he settled in Yásnaya Polyána, immediately
after having left the University, and when
extremely few thought of liberating the serfs. It was one of
those sketches of which Brandes has so truly said that in them
Tolstóy “thinks aloud” about some page of his own life. It
thus produced a certain mixed, undefined feeling. And yet
one could not but admire in it the same great objective talent
that was so striking in <i>Childhood</i> and the Sebastopol sketches.
In speaking of peasants who received with distrust the measures
with which their lord was going to benefit them, it
would have been so easy, so humanly natural, for an educated
man to throw upon their ignorance their unwillingness to
accept the threshing machine (which, by the way, did not
work), or the refusal of a peasant to accept the free gift of
a stone house (which was far from the village).... But
not a shade of that sort of pleading in favour of the landlord
is to be found in the story, and the thinking reader necessarily
concludes in favour of the common sense of the
peasants.</p>

<p>Then came <i>Lucerne</i>. It is told in that story how the same
Neklúdoff, bitterly struck by the indifference of a party of
English tourists who sat on the balcony of a rich Swiss hotel
and refused to throw even a few pennies to a poor singer
to whose songs they had listened with evident emotion, brings
the singer to the hotel, takes him to the dining-hall, to the
great scandal of the English visitors, and treats him there to
a bottle of champagne. The feelings of Neklúdoff are certainly
very just; but while reading this story one suffers all
the while for the poor musician, and experiences a sense of
anger against the Russian nobleman who uses him as a rod to
chastise the tourists, without even noticing how he makes the
old man miserable during this lesson in morals. The worst of
it is that the author, too, seems not to remark the false note
which rings in the conduct of Neklúdoff, nor to realise how a
man with really humane feelings would have taken the singer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
to some small wine-shop and would have had with him a
friendly talk over a <i>picholette</i> of common wine. Yet we see
again all Tolstóy’s force of talent. He so honestly, so fully,
and so truly describes the uneasiness of the singer during the
whole scene that the reader’s unavoidable conclusion is that
although the young aristocrat was right in protesting against
stone-heartedness, his ways were as unsympathetic as those of
the self-contented Englishmen at the hotel. Tolstóy’s artistic
power carries him beyond and above his theories.</p>

<p>This is not the only case where such a remark may be made
concerning Tolstóy’s work. His appreciation of this or that
action, of this or that of his heroes, may be wrong; his own
“philosophy” may be open to objection; but the force of his
descriptive talent and his literary honesty are always so
great, that he will often make the feelings and actions of his
heroes speak against their creator, and prove something very
different from what he intended to prove.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This is probably
why Turguéneff, and apparently other literary friends, too,
told him: “Don’t put your ‘philosophy into your art.’ Trust
to your artistic feeling, and you will create great things.” In
fact, notwithstanding Tolstóy’s distrust of science, I must say
that I always feel in reading his works that he is possessed
of the most <i>scientific</i> insight I know of among artists. He may
be wrong in his conclusions, but never is he wrong in his
statement of data. True science and true art are not hostile to
each other, but always work in harmony.</p>

<h3>SMALL STORIES—THE COSSACKS</h3>

<p>Several of Tolstóy’s novels and stories appeared in the
years 1857-1862 (<i>The Snow-Storm</i>, <i>The Two Hussars</i>,
<i>Three Deaths</i>, <i>The Cossacks</i>) and each one of them won
new admiration for his talent. The first is a mere trifle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
yet it is a gem of art; it concerns the wanderings of a traveller
during a snow-storm, in the plains of Central Russia. The
same remark is true of the <i>Two Hussars</i>, in which two generations
are sketched on a few pages with striking accuracy.
As to the deeply pantheistic <i>Three Deaths</i>, in which the death
of a rich lady, a poor horse-driver, and a birch-tree are contrasted,
it is a piece of poetry in prose that deserves a place
beside Goethe’s best pieces of pantheistic poetry, while for its
social significance it is already a forerunner of the Tolstóy of
the later epoch.</p>

<p><i>The Cossacks</i> is an autobiographical novel, and relates to
the time, already mentioned on a previous page, when Tolstóy
at twenty-four, running away from the meaningless life
he was living, went to Pyatigórsk, and then to a lonely Cossack
village on the Térek, hunted there in company with the
old Cossack Yeróshka and the young Lukáshka, and found
in the poetical enjoyment of a beautiful nature, in the plain
life of these squatters, and in the mute adoration of a Cossack
girl, the awakening of his wonderful literary genius.</p>

<p>The appearance of this novel, in which one feels a most
genuine touch of genius, provoked violent discussions. It
was begun in 1852, but was not published till 1860, when
all Russia was awaiting with anxiety the results of the work
of the Abolition of Serfdom Committees, foreseeing that
when serfdom should be done away with a complete destruction
of all other rotten, obsolete, and barbarous institutions of
past ages would have to begin. For this great work of reform
Russia looked to Western civilisation for inspiration and for
teachings. And there came a young writer who, following in
the steps of Rousseau, revolted against that civilisation and
preached a return to nature and the throwing off of the
artificialities we call civilised life, which are in reality a poor
substitute for the happiness of free work amidst a free nature.
Everyone knows by this time the dominant idea of <i>The
Cossacks</i>. It is the contrast between the natural life of these
sons of the prairies and the artificial life of the young officer
thrown in their midst. He tells of strong men who are similar
to the American squatters, and have been developed in the
Steppes at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, by a perilous
life, in which force, endurance, and calm courage are a first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
necessity. Into their midst comes one of the sickly products
of our semi-intellectual town life, and at every step he feels
himself the inferior of the Cossack Lukáshka. He wishes to
do something on a grand scale, but has neither the intellectual
nor the physical force to accomplish it. Even his love is not
the strong healthy love of the prairie man, but a sort of
slight excitement of the nerves, which evidently will not last,
and which only produces a similar restlessness in the Cossack
girl, but cannot carry her away. And when he talks to her of
love, in the force of which he himself does not believe, she
sends him off with the words: “Go away, you weakling!”</p>

<p>Some saw in that powerful novel such glorification of the
semi-savage state as that in which writers of the eighteenth
century, and especially Rousseau, are supposed to have indulged.
There is in Tolstóy nothing of the sort, as there was
nothing of the sort in Rousseau. But Tolstóy saw that in the
life of the Cossacks there is more <i>vitality</i>, more vigour, more
power, than in his well-born hero’s life—and he told it in a
beautiful and impressive form. His hero—like whom there
are thousands upon thousands—has none of the powers that
come from manual work and struggle with nature; and
neither has he those powers which knowledge and true civilisation
might have given him. A real intellectual power is
not asking itself at every moment, “Am I right, or am I
wrong?” It feels that there are principles in which it is not
wrong. The same is true of a moral force: it knows that to
such an extent it can trust to itself. But, like so many thousands
of men in the so-called educated classes, Neklúdoff has
neither of these powers. He is a weakling, and Tolstóy
brought out his intellectual and moral frailty with a distinctness
that was bound to produce a deep impression.</p>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL WORK</h3>

<p>In the years 1859-1862 the struggle between the
“fathers” and the “sons” which called forth violent attacks
against the young generation, even from such an “objective”
writer as Gontcharóff—to say nothing of Písemskiy
and several others,—was going on all over Russia. But we
do not know which side had Tolstóy’s sympathy. It must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
said, though, that most of this time he was abroad, with his
elder brother Nicholas, who died of consumption in the south
of France. All we know is that the failure of Western civilisation
in attaining any approach to well-being and equality for
the great masses of the people deeply struck Tolstóy; and
we are told by Venguéroff that the only men of mark whom
he went to see during this journey abroad were Auerbach,
who wrote at that time his Schwartzwald stories from the life
of the peasants and edited popular almanacks, and Proudhon,
who was then in exile at Brussels. Tolstóy returned to Russia
at the moment when the serfs were freed, accepted the position
of a <i>mirovóy posrédnik</i>, or arbitrator of peace between
the landlords and the freed serfs, and, settling at Yásnaya
Polyána, began there his work of education of children. This
he started on entirely independent lines,—that is, on purely
anarchistic principles, totally free from the artificial methods
of education which had been worked out by German pedagogists,
and were then greatly admired in Russia. There was no
sort of discipline in his school. Instead of working out programmes
according to which the children are to be taught, the
teacher, Tolstóy said, must learn from the children themselves
what to teach them, and must adapt his teaching to the
individual tastes and capacities of each child. Tolstóy carried
this out with his pupils, and obtained excellent results. His
methods, however, have as yet received but little attention;
and only one great writer—another poet, William Morris,—has
advocated (in <i>News from Nowhere</i>) the same freedom
in education. But we may be sure that some day Tolstóy’s
Yásnaya Polyána papers, studied by some gifted
teacher, as Rousseau’s <i>Emile</i> was studied by Froebel, will
become the starting point of an educational reform much
deeper than the reforms of Pestalozzi and Froebel.</p>

<p>It is now known that a violent end to this educational
experiment was put by the Russian Government. During
Tolstóy’s absence from his estate a searching was made by
the gendarmes, who not only frightened to death Tolstóy’s
old aunt (she fell ill after that) but visited every corner of
the house and read aloud, with cynical comments, the most
intimate diary which the great writer had kept since his
youth. More searchings were promised, so that Tolstóy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
intended to emigrate for ever to London, and warned Alexander
II., through the Countess A. A. Tolstáya that he kept
a loaded revolver by his side and would shoot down the first
police officer who would dare to enter his house. The school
had evidently to be closed.</p>

<h3>WAR AND PEACE</h3>

<p>In the year 1862 Tolstóy married the young daughter
of a Moscow doctor, Bers; and, staying nearly without
interruption on his Túla estate, he gave his time, for the
next fifteen or sixteen years, to his great work, <i>War and
Peace</i>, and next to <i>Anna Karénina</i>. His first intention was to
write (probably utilising some family traditions and documents)
a great historical novel, <i>The Decembrists</i> (see Chapter
I.), and he finished in 1863 the first chapters of this novel
(Vol. III. of his <i>Works</i>, in Russian; Moscow, 10th edition).
But in trying to create the types of the Decembrists he must
have been taken back in his thoughts to the great war of
1812. He had heard so much about it in the family traditions
of the Tolstóys and Volkhónskys, and that war had so
much in common with the Crimean war through which he
himself had lived that he came to write this great epopee,
<i>War and Peace</i>, which has no parallel in any literature.</p>

<p>A whole epoch, from 1805 to 1812, is reconstituted in
these volumes, and its meaning appears—not from the conventional
historian’s point of view, but as it was understood
then by those who lived and acted in those years. All the
Society of those times passes before the reader, from its
highest spheres, with their heart-rending levity, conventional
ways of thinking, and superficiality, down to the simplest
soldier in the army, who bore the hardships of that terrible
conflict as a sort of ordeal that was sent by a supreme power
upon the Russians, and who forgot himself and his own sufferings
in the life and sufferings of the nation. A fashionable
drawing-room at St. Petersburg, the <i>salon</i> of a person who
is admitted into the intimacy of the dowager-empress; the
quarters of the Russian diplomatists in Austria and the
Austrian Court; the thoughtless life of the Róstoff family at
Moscow and on their estate; the austere house of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
general, Prince Bolkónskiy; then the camp life of the Russian
General Staff and of Napoléon on the one hand, and on
the other, the inner life of a simple regiment of the hussars
or of a field-battery; then such world-battles as Schöngraben,
the disaster of Austerlitz, Smolénsk, and Borodinó; the
abandonment and the burning of Moscow; the life of those
Russian prisoners who had been arrested pell-mell during the
conflagration and were executed in batches; and finally the
horrors of the retreat of Napoléon from Moscow, and the
guerilla warfare—all this immense variety of scenes, events,
and small episodes, interwoven with romance of the deepest
interest, is unrolled before us as we read the pages of this
epopee of Russia’s great conflict with Western Europe.</p>

<p>We make acquaintance with more than a hundred different
persons, and each of them is so well depicted, each has his
or her own <i>human</i> physiognomy so well determined, that each
one appears with his or her own individuality, distinct
amongst the scores of actors in the same great drama. It is
not so easy to forget even the least important of these figures,
be it one of the ministers of Alexander I. or any one of the
ordinances of the calvary officers. Nay, every anonymous
soldier of various rank—the infantryman, the hussar, or the
artilleryman—has his own physiognomy; even the different
chargers of Róstoff, or of Denísoff, stand out with individual
features. When you think of the variety of human characters
which pass under your eyes on these pages, you have the real
sensation of a vast crowd—of historical events that you seem
to have lived through—of a whole nation roused by a calamity;
while the impression you retain of human beings whom
you have loved in <i>War and Peace</i>, or for whom you have suffered
when misfortune befell them, or when they themselves
have wronged others (as for instance, the old countess Róstoff
and Sónitchka)—the impression left by these persons, when
they emerge in your memory from the crowd, gives to that
crowd the same illusion of reality which little details give to
the personality of a hero.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in an historical novel lies not so much
in the representation of secondary figures as in painting the
great historical personalities—the chief actors of the historical
drama—so as to make of them real, living beings. But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
is exactly where Tolstóy has succeeded most wonderfully. His
Bagratión, his Alexander I., his Napoléon, and his Kutúzoff
are living men, so realistically represented that one <i>sees</i> them
and is tempted to seize the brush and paint them, or to
imitate their movements and ways of talking.</p>

<p>The “philosophy of war” which Tolstóy had developed
in <i>War and Peace</i> has provoked, as is well known, passionate
discussion and bitter criticism; and yet its correctness
cannot but be recognised. In fact, it is recognised by such as
know war from within, or have witnessed human mass-actions.
Of course, those who know war from newspaper
reports, especially such officers as, after having recited many
times over an “improved” report of a battle as <i>they</i> would
have liked it to be, giving themselves a leading <i>rôle</i>—such
men will not agree with Tolstóy’s ways of dealing with
“heroes”; but it is sufficient to read, for instance, what
Moltke and Bismarck wrote in their private letters about the
war of 1870-71, or the plain, honest descriptions of some historical
event with which we occasionally meet, to understand
Tolstóy’s views of war and his conceptions of the extremely
limited part played by “heroes” in historical events. Tolstóy
did not invent the artillery officer Timókhin who had been
forgotten by his superiors in the centre of the Schöngraben
position, and who, continuing all day long to use his four
guns with initiative and discernment, prevented the battle
from ending in disaster for the Russian rearguard: he
knew only too well of such Timókhins in Sebastopol. They
compose the real vital force of every army in the world; and
the success of an army depends infinitely more upon its number
of Timókhins than upon the genius of its high commanders.
This is where Tolstóy and Moltke are of one
mind, and where they entirely disagree with the “war-correspondent”
and with the General Staff historians.</p>

<p>In the hands of a writer possessed of less genius than
Tolstóy, such a thesis might have failed to appear convincing;
but in <i>War and Peace</i> it appears almost with the force of self-evidence.
Tolstóy’s Kutúzoff is—as he was in reality—quite
an ordinary man; but he was a great man for the precise reason,
that, forseeing the unavoidable and almost fatal drift of
events, instead of pretending that he directed them, he simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
did his best to utilise the vital forces of his army in order to
avoid still greater disasters.</p>

<p>It hardly need be said that <i>War and Peace</i> is a powerful
indictment against war. The effect which the great writer has
exercised in this direction upon his generation can be actually
seen in Russia. It was already apparent during the great
Turkish war of 1877-78, when it was absolutely impossible
to find in Russia a correspondent who would have described
how “<i>we</i> have peppered the enemy with grape-shot,” or how
“we shot them down like nine-pins.” If a man could have
been found to use in his letters such survivals of savagery, no
paper would have dared to print them. The general character
of the Russian war-correspondent had grown totally different;
and during the same war there came to the front such a novelist
as Gárshin and such a painter as Vereschágin, with whom
to combat war became a life work.</p>

<p>Everyone who has read <i>War and Peace</i> remembers, of
course, the hard experiences of Pierre, and his friendship
with the soldier Karatáeff. One feels that Tolstóy is full of
admiration for the quiet philosophy of this man of the people,—a
typical representative of the ordinary, common-sense Russian
peasant. Some literary critics concluded that Tolstóy was
preaching in Karatáeff a sort of Oriental fatalism. In the
present writer’s opinion there is nothing of the sort. Karatáeff,
who is a consistent pantheist, simply knows that there are
natural calamities, which it is impossible to resist; and he
knows that the miseries which befall him—his personal
sufferings, and eventually the shooting of a number of
prisoners among whom to-morrow he may or may not be
included—are the unavoidable consequences of a much
greater event: the armed conflict between nations, which,
once it has begun, must unroll itself with all its revolting
but absolutely ungovernable consequences. Karatáeff acts as
one of those cows on the slope of an Alpine mountain, mentioned
by the philosopher Guyau, which, when it feels that
it begins to slip down a steep mountain slope, makes at first
desperate efforts to hold its ground, but when it sees that
no effort can arrest its fatal gliding, lets itself quietly
be dragged down into the abyss. Karatáeff accepts the
inevitable; but he is not a fatalist. If he had felt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
his efforts could prevent war, he would have exerted
them. In fact, towards the end of the work, when Pierre tells
his wife Natásha that he is going to join the Decembrists (it
is told in veiled words, on account of censorship, but a
Russian reader understands nevertheless), and she asks
him: “Would Platón Karatáeff approve of it?” Pierre,
after a moment’s reflection, answers decidedly, “Yes, he
would.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what a Frenchman, an Englishman, or a
German feels when he reads <i>War and Peace</i>—I have heard
educated Englishmen telling me that they found it dull—but
I know that for educated Russians the reading of nearly
every scene in <i>War and Peace</i> is a source of indescribable
æsthetic pleasure. Having, like so many Russians, read the
work many times, I could not, if I were asked, name the
scenes which delight me most: the romances among the
children, the mass-effects in the war scenes, the regimental
life, the inimitable scenes from the life of the Court, aristocracy,
the tiny details concerning Napoléon or Kutúzoff, or
the life of the Róstoffs—the dinner, the hunt, the departure
from Moscow, and so on.</p>

<p>Many felt offended, in reading this epopee, to see their
hero, Napoléon, reduced to such small proportions, and even
ridiculed. But the Napoléon who came to Russia was no
longer the man who had inspired the armies of the <i>sans-culottes</i>
in their first steps eastwards for the abolition of
serfdom, absolutism, and inquisition. All men in high positions
are actors to a great extent—as Tolstóy so wonderfully
shows in so many places of his great work—and Napoléon
surely was not the least actor among them. And by the time
he came to Russia, an emperor, now spoiled by the adulation
of the courtiers of all Europe and the worship of the
masses, who attributed to him what was attributable to the
vast stir of minds produced by the Great Revolution, and
consequently saw in him a half-god—by the time he came
to Russia, the actor in him had got the upper hand over the
man in whom there had been formerly incarnated the youthful
energy of the suddenly-awakened French nation, in whom
had appeared the expression of that awakening, and through
whom its force had been the further increased. To these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
original characteristics was due the fascination which the
name of Napoléon exercised upon his contemporaries. At
Smolénsky, Kutúzoff himself must have experienced that fascination
when, rather than rouse the lion to a desperate battle,
he opened before him the way to retreat.</p>

<h3>ANNA KARÉNINA.</h3>

<p>Of all the Tolstóy novels, <i>Anna Karénina</i> is the one
which has been the most widely read in all languages. As
a work of art it is a master-piece. From the very first appearance
of the heroine, you feel that this woman must bring
with her a drama; from the very outset her tragical end is
as inevitable as it is in a drama of Shakespeare. In that
sense the novel is true to life throughout. It is a corner of
real life that we have before us. As a rule, Tolstóy is not
at his best in picturing women—with the exception of very
young girls—and I don’t think that Anna Karénina herself
is as deep, as psychologically complete, and as living a creation
as she might have been; but the more ordinary woman,
Dolly, is simply teeming with life. As to the various scenes
of the novel—the ball scenes, the races of the officers, the
inner family life of Dolly, the country scenes on Lévin’s
estate, the death of his brother, and so on—all these are
depicted in such a way that for its artistic qualities <i>Anna
Karénina</i> stands foremost even amongst the many beautiful
things Tolstóy has written.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding all that, the novel produced in
Russia a decidedly unfavourable impression, which brought
to Tolstóy congratulations from the reactionary camp and
a very cool reception from the advanced portion of society.
The fact is, that the question of marriage and of an eventual
separation between husband and wife had been most earnestly
debated in Russia by the best men and women, both in literature
and in life. It is self-evident that such indifferent levity
towards marriage as is continually unveiled before the Courts
in “Society” divorce cases was absolutely and unconditionally
condemned; and that any form of deceit, such as makes
the subject of countless French novels and dramas, was ruled
out of question in any honest discussion of the matter. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
after the above levity and deceit had been severely branded,
the rights of a new love, serious and deep, appearing after
years of happy married life, had only been the more seriously
analysed. Tchernyshévskiy’s novel, <i>What is to be done</i>,
can be taken as the best expression of the opinions upon
marriage which had become current amongst the better
portion of the young generation. Once you are married,
it was said, don’t take lightly to love affairs, or so-called
flirtation. Every fit of passion does not deserve the name
of a new love; and what is sometimes described as love is
in a very great number of cases nothing but temporary
desire. Even if it were real love, before a real and deep
love has grown up, there is in most cases a period when
one has time to reflect upon the consequences that would
follow if the beginnings of his or her new sympathy should
attain the depth of such a love. But, with all that, there
are cases when a new love does come, and there are cases
when such an event must happen almost fatally, when, for
instance, a girl has been married almost against her will,
under the continued insistence of her lover, or when the
two have married without properly understanding each other,
or when one of the two has continued to progress in his or
her development towards a higher ideal, while the other,
after having worn for some time the mask of idealism, falls
into the Philistine happiness of warmed slippers. In such
cases separation not only becomes inevitable, but it often is to
the interest of both. It would be much better for both to live
through the sufferings which a separation would involve
(honest natures are by such sufferings made better) than to
spoil the entire subsequent existence of the one—in most
cases, of both—and to face moreover the fatal results that
living together under such circumstances would necessarily
mean for the children. This was, at least, the conclusion to
which both Russian literature and the best all-round portion
of our society had come.</p>

<p>And now came Tolstóy with <i>Anna Karénina</i>, which bears
the menacing biblical epigraph: “Vengeance is mine, and I
will repay it,” and in which the biblical revenge falls upon
the unfortunate Karénina, who puts an end by suicide to her
sufferings after her separation from her husband. Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
critics evidently could not accept Tolstóy’s views. The case
of Karénina was one of those where there could be no question
of “vengeance.” She was married as a young girl to an
old and unattractive man. At that time she did not know
exactly what she was doing, and nobody had explained it to
her. She had never known love, and learned it for the first
time when she saw Vrónskiy. Deceit, for her, was absolutely
out of the question; and to keep up a merely conventional
marriage would have been a sacrifice which would not have
made her husband and child any happier. Separation, and a
new life with Vrónskiy, who seriously loved her, was the only
possible outcome. At any rate, if the story of Anna Karénina
had to end in tragedy, it was not in the least in consequence
of an act of supreme justice. As always, the honest artistic
genius of Tolstóy had itself indicated another cause—the
real one. It was the inconsistency of Vrónskiy and Karénina.
After having separated from her husband and defied “public
opinion”—that is, the opinion of women who, as Tolstóy
shows it himself, were not honest enough to be allowed any
voice in the matter—neither she nor Vrónskiy had the courage
of breaking entirely with that society, the futility of
which Tolstóy knows and describes so exquisitely. Instead of
that, when Anna returned with Vrónskiy to St. Petersburg,
her own and Vrónskiy’s chief preoccupation was—How
Betsey and other such women would receive her, if she made
her appearance among them. And it was the opinion of the
Betsies—surely not Superhuman Justice—which brought
Karénina to suicide.</p>

<h3>RELIGIOUS CRISIS</h3>

<p>Everyone knows the profound change which took place
in Tolstóy’s fundamental conceptions of life in the years
1875-1878, when he had reached the age of about fifty. I do
not think that one has the right to discuss publicly what has
been going on in the very depths of another’s mind; but, by
telling us himself the inner drama and the struggles which
he has lived through, the great writer has, so to say, invited
us to verify whether he was correct in his reasonings and
conclusions; and limiting ourselves to the psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
material which he has given us, we may discuss it without
undue intrusion into the motives of his actions.</p>

<p>It is most striking to find, on re-reading the earlier works
of Tolstóy, how the ideas which he advocates at the present
time were always cropping up in his earlier writings.
Philosophical questions and questions concerning the moral
foundations of life interested him from his early youth. At
the age of sixteen he used to read philosophical works, and
during his university years, and even through “the stormy
days of passion,” questions as to how we ought to live rose
with their full importance before him. His autobiographical
novels, especially <i>Youth</i>, bear deep traces of that inner work
of his mind, even though, as he says in <i>Confession</i>, he has
never said all he might have said on this subject. Nay, it is
evident that although he describes his frame of mind in those
years as that of “a philosophical Nihilist,” he had never
parted, in reality, with the beliefs of his childhood.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He
always was an admirer and follower of Rousseau. In his
papers on education (collected in Vol. IV. of the tenth
Moscow edition of his <i>Works</i>) one finds treated in a very
radical way most of the burning social questions which he
has discussed in his later years. These questions even then
worried him so much that, while he was carrying on his school
work in Yásnaya Polyána and was a Peace Mediator—that
is, in the years 1861-62—he grew so disgusted with the
unavoidable dualism of his position of a benevolent landlord,
that—to quote his own words—“I should have come then,
perhaps, to the crisis which I reached fifteen years later, if
there had not remained one aspect of life which promised me
salvation—namely, married life.” In other words, Tolstóy
was already very near to breaking with the privileged class
point of view on Property and Labour, and to joining the
great populistic movement which was already beginning in
Russia. This he probably would have done, had not a new
world of love, family life, and family interests, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
embraced with the usual intensity of his passionate nature,
fastened the ties that kept him attached to his own class.</p>

<p>Art, too, must have contributed to divert his attention from
the social problem—at least, from its economic aspects. In
<i>War and Peace</i> he developed the philosophy of <i>the masses
versus the heroes</i>, a philosophy which in those years would
have found among the educated men of all Europe very
few persons ready to accept it. Was it his poetical genius
which revealed to him the part played by the masses in the
great war of 1812, and taught him that they—the masses,
and not the heroes—had accomplished all the great things in
history? Or, was it but a further development of the ideas
which inspired him in his Yásnaya Polyána school, in opposition
to all the educational theories that had been elaborated
by Church and State in the interest of the privileged classes?
At any rate, <i>War and Peace</i> must have offered him a problem
great enough to absorb his thoughts for a number of years;
and in writing this monumental work, in which he strove to
promote a new conception of history, he must have felt that
he was working in the right way. As to <i>Anna Karénina</i>, which
had no such reformatory or philosophical purpose, it must
have offered to Tolstóy the possibility of living through once
more, with all the intensity of poetical creation, the shallow
life of the leisured classes, and to contrast it with the life of
the peasants and their work. And it was while he was finishing
this novel that he began to fully realise how much his own
life was in opposition to the ideals of his earlier years.</p>

<p>A terrible conflict must have been going on then in the
mind of the great writer. The communistic feeling which had
induced him to put in italics the fact about the singer at
<i>Lucerne</i>, and to add to it a hot indictment against the civilisation
of the moneyed classes; the trend of thought which had
dictated his severe criticisms against private property in
<i>Holstomyér: the History of a Horse</i>; the anarchistic ideas
which had brought him, in his Yásnaya Polyána educational
articles, to a negation of a civilisation based on Capitalism
and State; and, on the other hand, his individual property
conceptions, which he tried to conciliate with his communistic
leanings (see the conversation between the two brothers
Lévin in <i>Anna Karénina</i>); his want of sympathy with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
parties which stood in opposition to the Russian Government
and, at the same time, his profound, deeply rooted dislike of
that Government, all these tendencies must have been in an
irreconcilable conflict in the mind of the great writer, with all
the passionate intensity which is characteristic of Tolstóy, as
with all men of genius. These constant contradictions were so
apparent that while less perspicacious Russian critics and the
<i>Moscow Gazette</i> defenders of serfdom considered Tolstóy
as having joined their reactionary camp, a gifted Russian
critic, Mihailóvskiy, published in 1875 a series of remarkable
articles, entitled <i>The Right Hand and the Left Hand of
Count Tolstóy</i>, in which he pointed out the two men who
constantly were in conflict in the great writer. In these articles,
the young critic, a great admirer of Tolstóy, analysed the
advanced ideas which he had developed in his educational
articles, which were almost quite unknown at that time, and
contrasted them with the strangely conservative ideas which
he had expressed in his later writings. As a consequence,
Mihailóvskiy predicted a crisis to which the great writer
was inevitably coming.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will not speak,” he wrote, “of <i>Anna Karénina</i>, first of all
because it is not yet terminated, and second, because one must speak
of it very much, or not at all. I shall only remark that in this novel—much
more superficially, but for that very reason perhaps even more
distinctly than anywhere else—one sees the traces of the drama which
is going on in the soul of the author. One asks oneself what such a
man is to do, how can he live, how shall he avoid that poisoning
of his consciousness which at every step intrudes into the pleasures
of a satisfied need? Most certainly he must, even though it may be
instinctively, seek for a means to put an end to the inner drama
of his soul, to drop the curtain; but how to do it? I think that if
an ordinary man were in such a position, he would have ended in
suicide or in drunkenness. A man of value will, on the contrary,
seek for other issues, and of such issues there are several.” (<i>Otéchestvennyia
Zapíski</i>, a review, June, 1875; also Mihailóvskiy’s
<i>Works</i>, Vol. III, p. 491.)</p>
</div>

<p>One of these issues—Mihailóvskiy continued—would be
to write for the people. Of course, very few are so happy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
to possess the talent and the faculties which are necessary
for that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But once he (Tolstóy) is persuaded that the nation consists of
two halves, and that even the ‘innocent’ pleasures of the one half
are to the disadvantage of the other half—why should he not devote
his formidable forces to this immense task? It is even difficult to
imagine that any other theme could interest the writer who carries
in his soul such a terrible drama as the one that Count Tolstóy carries.
So deep and so serious is it, so deeply does it go to the root of all
literary activity, that it must presumably destroy all other interests,
just as the creeper suffocates all other plants. And, is it not a sufficiently
high aim in life, always to remind ‘Society’ that its pleasures
and amusements are not the pleasures and the amusements of all
mankind, to explain to ‘Society’ the true sense of the phenomena of
progress, to wake up, be it only in the few, the more impressionable,
the conscience and the feeling of justice? And is not this field wide
enough for poetical creation?...</p>

<p>“The drama which is going on in Count Tolstóy’s soul is my
hypothesis,” Mihailóvskiy concluded, “but it is a legitimate hypothesis
without which it is impossible to understand his writings.”
(<i>Works</i>, III, 496.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is now known how much Mihailóvskiy’s hypothesis was
a prevision. In the years 1875-76, as Tolstóy was finishing
<i>Anna Karénina</i>, he began fully to realise the shallowness and
the duality of the life that he had hitherto led. “Something
strange,” he says, “began to happen within me: I began to
experience minutes of bewilderment, of arrest of life, as if I
did not know how to live and what to do.” “What for?
What next?” were the questions which began to rise before
him. “Well,” he said to himself, “you will have 15,000
acres of land in Samara, 3000 horses—but what of that?
And I was bewildered, and did not know what to think next.”
Literary fame had lost for him its attraction, now that he
had reached the great heights to which <i>War and Peace</i> had
brought him. The little picture of Philistine family-happiness
which he had pictured in a novel before his marriage (<i>Family
Happiness</i>) he had now lived through, but it no longer
satisfied him. The life of Epicureanism which he had led
hitherto had lost all sense for him. “I felt,” he writes
in <i>Confession</i>, “that what I had stood upon had broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
down; that there was nothing for me to stand upon; that
what I had lived by was no more, and that there was nothing
left me to live by. My life had come to a stop.” The so-called
“family duties” had lost their interest. When he thought
of the education of his children, he asked himself, “What
for?” and very probably he felt that in his landlord’s surroundings
he never would be able to give them a better
education than his own, which he condemned; and when he
began thinking of the well-being of the masses he would all
of a sudden ask himself: “What business have I to think
of it?”</p>

<p>He felt that he had nothing to live for. He even had no
wishes which he could recognise as reasonable. “If a fairy
had come to me, and offered to satisfy my wish, I should not
have known what to wish ... I even could not wish to
know Truth, because I had guessed of what it would consist.
The Truth was, that life is nonsense.” He had no aim in
life, no purpose, and he realised that without a purpose, and
with its unavoidable sufferings, life is not worth living (<i>Confession</i>,
VI, VII).</p>

<p>He had not—to use his own expression—“the moral
bluntness of imagination” which would be required not to
have his Epicureanism poisoned by the surrounding misery;
and yet, like Schopenhauer, he had not the Will that was
necessary for adjusting his actions in accordance with the
dictates of his reason. Self-annihilation, death, appeared
therefore as a welcome solution.</p>

<p>However, Tolstóy was too strong a man to end his life in
suicide. He found an outcome, and that outcome was indicated
to him by a return to the love which he had cherished
in his youth: <i>the love of the peasant masses</i>. “Was it in consequence
of a strange, so to say a physical love of the truly
working people,” he writes—or of some other cause? but
he understood at last that he must seek the sense of life
among the millions who toil all their life long. He began to
examine with more attention than before the life of these
millions. “And I began,” he says, “to love these people.”
And the more he penetrated into their lives, past and present,
the more he loved them, and “the easier it was for me to
live.” As to the life of the men of his own circle—the wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
and cultured, “I not only felt disgust for it: it lost all sense
in my eyes.” He understood that if he did not see what life
was worth living for, it was his own life “in exclusive conditions
of epicureanism” which had obscured the truth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I understood,” he continues, “that my question, ‘What is life?’
and my reply to it, ‘Evil,’ were quite correct. I was only wrong
in applying them to life altogether. To the question, ‘What is life?’ I
had got the reply, ‘Evil and nonsense!’ And so it was. My own
life—a life of indulgence in passions—was void of sense and full of
evil, but this was true of my life only, not of the life of all men.
Beginning with the birds and the lowest animals, all live to maintain
life and to secure it for others besides themselves, while I not only did
not secure it for others: I did not secure it even for myself. I lived
as a parasite, and, having put to myself the question, ‘What do I
live for?’ I got the reply, ‘For no purpose.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The conviction, then, that he must live as the millions live,
earning his own livelihood; that he must toil as the millions
toil; and that such a life is the <i>only</i> possible reply to the questions
which had brought him to despair—the only way to
escape the terrible contradictions which had made Schopenhauer
preach self-annihilation, and Solomon, Sakiamuni, and
so many others preach their gospel of despairing pessimism,
this conviction, then, saved him and restored to him lost
energy and the will to live. But that same idea had inspired
thousands of the Russian youth, in those same years, and had
induced them to start the great movement “<i>V narod!</i>”
“Towards the people; be the people!”</p>

<p>Tolstóy has told us in an admirable book, <i>What is, then, to
be done?</i> the impressions which the slums of Moscow produced
upon him in 1881, and the influence they had upon the
ulterior development of his thoughts. But we do not yet know
what facts and impressions made him so vividly realise in
1875-81 the emptiness of the life which he had been hitherto
leading. Is it then presuming too much if I suggest that it
was this very same movement, “towards the people,” which
had inspired so many of the Russian youth to go to the
villages and the factories, and to live there the life of the
people, which finally brought Tolstóy, also, to reconsider his
position as a rich landlord?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>That he knew of this movement there is not the slightest
doubt. The trial of the Netcháeff groups in 1871 was printed
in full in the Russian newspapers, and one could easily read
through all the youthful immaturity of the speeches of the
accused the high motives and the love of the people which
inspired them. The trial of the Dolgúshin groups, in 1875,
produced a still deeper impression in the same direction; but
especially the trial, in March, 1877, of those of transcendent
worth, girls Bárdina, Lubatóvitch, the sisters Subbótin, “the
Moscow Fifty” as they were named in the circles, who, all
from wealthy families, had led the life of factory girls, in the
horrible factory-barracks, working fourteen and sixteen hours
a day, in order to be with the working people and to teach
them.... And then—the trial of the “Hundred-and-Ninety-Three”
and of Véra Zasúlitch in 1878. However
great Tolstóy’s dislike of revolutionists might have been, he
must have felt, as he read the reports of these trials, or heard
what was said about them at Moscow and in his province of
Túla, and witnessed round him the impression they had
produced—he, the great artist, must have felt that this youth
was much nearer to what he himself was in his earlier days,
in 1861-62, than to those among whom he lived now—the
Katkóffs, the “Fets,” and the like. And then, even if he
knew nothing about these trials and had heard nothing
about the “Moscow Fifty,” he knew, at least, Turguéneff’s
<i>Virgin Soil</i>, which was published in January, 1877,
and he must have felt, even from that imperfect picture,
so warmly greeted by young Russia, what this young Russia
was.</p>

<p>If Tolstóy had been in his twenties, he might possibly have
joined the movement, in one form or another, notwithstanding
all the obstacles. Such as he was, in his surroundings, and
especially with his mind already preoccupied by the problem—“Where
is the lever which would move human hearts
at large, and become the source of the deep moral reform of
every individual?” with such a question on his mind, he had
to live through many a struggle before he was brought consciously
to take the very same step. For our young men and
women, the mere statement that one who had got an education,
thanks to the work of the masses, owed it therefore to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
these masses to work in return for them—this simple
statement was sufficient. They left their wealthy houses, took
to the simplest life, hardly different from that of a workingman,
and devoted their lives to the people. But for many
reasons—such as education, habits, surroundings, age, and,
perhaps, the great philosophical question he had in his
mind, Tolstóy had to live through the most painful struggles,
before he came to the very same conclusion, but in a different
way: that is to say, before he concluded that he, as the bearer
of a portion of the divine Unknown, had to fulfil the will
of that Unknown, which will was that everyone should work
for the universal welfare.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The moment, however, that he came to this conclusion, he
did not hesitate to act in accordance with it. The difficulties
he met in his way, before he could follow the injunction of
his conscience, must have been immense. We can faintly guess
them. The sophisms he had to combat—especially when all
those who understood the value of his colossal talent began
to protest against his condemnation of his previous writing—we
can also easily imagine. And one can but admire the force
of his convictions, when he entirely reformed the life he had
hitherto led.</p>

<p>The small room he took in his rich mansion is well known
through a world-renowned photograph. Tolstóy behind the
plough, painted by Ryépin, has gone the round of the world,
and is considered by the Russian Government so dangerous
an image that it has been taken from the public gallery where
it was exhibited. Limiting his own living to the strictly
necessary minimum of the plainest sort of food, he did his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
best, so long as his physical forces lasted, to earn that little
by physical work. And for the last years of his life he has
been writing even more than he ever did in the years of his
greatest literary productivity.</p>

<p>The effects of this example which Tolstóy has given mankind
everyone knows. He believes, however, that he must
give also the philosophical and religious reasons for his
conduct, and this he did in a series of remarkable works.</p>

<p>Guided by the idea that millions of plain working people
realised the sense of life, and found it in life itself, which
they considered as the accomplishment of “the will of the
Creator of the universe,” he accepted the simple creed of the
masses of the Russian peasants, even though his mind was
reluctant to do so, and followed with them the rites of the
Greek Orthodox Church. There was a limit, however, to such
a concession, and there were beliefs which he positively could
not accept. He felt that when he was, for instance, solemnly
declaring during the mass, before communion, that he took
the latter in the literal sense of the words—not figuratively—he
was affirming something which he could not say in full
conscience. Besides, he soon made the acquaintance of the
Non-conformist peasants, Sutyáeff and Bondaryóff, whom he
deeply respected, and he saw, from his intercourse with them,
that by joining the Greek Orthodox Church he was lending
a hand to all its abominable prosecutions of the Non-conformists—that
he was a party to the hatred which all Churches
profess towards each other.</p>

<p>Consequently, he undertook a complete study of Christianity,
irrespective of the teachings of the different churches,
including a careful revision of the translations of the gospels,
with the intention of finding out what was the real meaning
of the Great Teacher’s precepts, and what had been added to
it by his followers. In a remarkable, most elaborate work
(<i>Criticism of Dogmatic Theology</i>), he demonstrated how
fundamentally the interpretations of the Churches differed
from what was in his opinion the true sense of the words of
the Christ. And then he worked out, quite independently, an
interpretation of the Christian teaching which is quite similar
to the interpretations that have been given to it by all the
great popular movements—in the ninth century in Armenia,—later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
on by Wycliff, and by the early Anabaptists, such as
Hans Denck,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> laying, however, like the Quakers, especial
stress on the doctrine of non-resistance.</p>

<h3>HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE CHRISTIAN TEACHING</h3>

<p>The ideas which Tolstóy thus slowly worked out are
explained in a succession of three separate works: (1) <i>Dogmatic
Theology</i>, of which the Introduction is better known as
<i>Confession</i> and was written in 1882; (2) <i>What is my Faith?</i>
(1884); and (3) <i>What is then to be Done?</i> (1886), to
which must be added <i>The Kingdom of God in Yourselves, or
Christianity, not as a mystic Teaching but as a new Understanding
of Life</i> (1900) and, above all, a small book, <i>The
Christian Teaching</i> (1902), which is written in short, concise,
numbered paragraphs, like a catechism, and contains a
full and definite exposition of Tolstóy’s views. A number of
other works dealing with the same subject—such as <i>The Life
and the Teachings of the Christ</i>, <i>My Reply to the Synod’s
Edict of Excommunication</i>, <i>What is Religion</i>, <i>On Life</i>, etc.,
were published during the same year. These books represent
the work of Tolstóy for the last twenty years, and at least
four of them (<i>Confession</i>, <i>My Faith</i>, <i>What is to be Done</i>,
and <i>Christian Teaching</i>) must be read in the indicated succession
by everyone who wishes to know the religious and
moral conceptions of Tolstóy and to extricate himself from
the confused ideas which are sometimes represented as Tolstóyism.
As to the short work, <i>The Life and the Teaching of
Jesus</i>, it is, so to speak, the four gospels in one, told in a
language easy to be understood, and free of all mystical and
metaphorical elements; it contains Tolstóy’s reading of the
gospels.</p>

<p>These works represent the most remarkable attempt at a
rationalistic interpretation of Christianity that has ever been
ventured upon. Christianity appears in them devoid of all
gnosticism and mysticism, as a purely spiritual teaching about
the universal spirit which guides man to a higher life—a life
of equality and of friendly relations with all men. If Tolstóy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
accepts Christianity as the foundation of his faith, it is not
because he considers it as a revelation, but because its teaching,
purified of all the additions that have been made to it
by the churches, contains “the very same solution of the
problem of life as has been given more or less explicitly by
the best of men, both before and since the gospel was given to
us—a succession which goes on from Moses, Isaiah, and
Confucius, to the early Greeks, Buddha, and Socrates, down
to Pascal, Spinoza, Fichte, Feuerbach, and all others, often
unnoticed and unknown, who, taking no teachings on mere
trust, have taught us, and spoken to us with sincerity, about
the meaning of life”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; because it gives “an explanation
of the meaning of life” and “a solution of this contradiction
between the aspiration after welfare and life, and the
consciousness of their being unattainable” (<i>Chr. Teach.</i>
§13)—“between the desire for happiness and life on the
one hand, and the increasingly clear perception of the certainty
of calamity and death on the other” (<i>ibid.</i>, §10).</p>

<p>As to the dogmatic and mystical elements of Christianity,
which he treats as mere additions to the real teaching of
Christ, he considers them so noxious that even he makes the
following remark: “It is terrible to say so (but sometimes I
have this thought): if the teaching of Christ, together with
the teaching of the Church that has grown upon it, did not
exist at all—those who now call themselves Christians would
have been nearer to the teachings of Christ—that is, to an
intelligent teaching about the good of life—than they are
now. The moral teachings of all the prophets of mankind
would not have been closed for them.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Putting aside all the mystical and metaphysical conceptions
which have been interwoven with Christianity, he concentrates
his main attention upon the moral aspects of the Christian
teaching. One of the most powerful means—he says—by
which men are prevented from living a life in accordance
with this teaching is “religious deception.” “Humanity
moves slowly but unceasingly onward, towards an ever higher
development of consciousness of the true meaning of life, and
towards the organisation of life in conformity with this
development of consciousness;” but in this ascendant march
all men do not move at an equal pace, and “the less sensitive
continue to adhere to the previous understanding and order
of life, and try to uphold it.” This they achieve mainly by
means of the religious deception which consists “in the intentional
confusion of faith with superstition, and the substitution
of the one for the other.” (<i>Chr. Teach.</i>, §§181, 180.)
The only means to free one’s self from this deception is—he
says—“to understand and to remember that the only instrument
which man possesses for the acquisition of knowledge
is reason, and that therefore every teaching which affirms
that which is contrary to reason is a delusion.” Altogether,
Tolstóy is especially emphatic upon this point of the importance
of reason. (See <i>The Christian Teaching</i>, §§206, 214.)</p>

<p>Another great obstacle to the spreading of the Christian
teaching he sees in the current belief in the immortality of
the soul—such as it is understood now. (<i>My Belief</i>, p. 134
of Tchertkoff’s Russ. ed.) In this form he repudiates it; but
we can—he says—give a deeper meaning to our life by making
it to be a service to men—to mankind—by merging our
life into the life of the universe; and although this idea may
seem less attractive than the idea of individual immortality,
“though little, it is sure.” (<i>Chr. Teaching.</i>)</p>

<p>In speaking of God he takes sometimes a pantheistic position,
and describes God as Life, or as Love, or else as the
Ideal which man is conscious of in himself (<i>Thoughts about
God</i>, collected by V. and A. Tchertkoff); but in his last work
(<i>Christian Teaching</i>, ch. VII. and VIII.) he prefers to identify
God with “the universal desire for welfare which is the
source of all life.” “So that, according to the Christian teaching,
God is that Essence of life which man recognises both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
within himself and in the whole universe as the desire for welfare;
it being at the same time the cause by which this Essence
is enclosed and conditioned in individual and corporal life”
(§36). Every reasoning man—Tolstóy adds—comes to a
similar conclusion. A desire for <i>universal</i> welfare appears in
every reasoning man, after his rational consciousness has been
awakened at a certain age; and in the world around Man
the same desire is manifest in all separate beings, each of
whom strives for his own welfare (§37). These two desires
“converge towards one distinct purpose—definite, attainable,
and joyful for man.” Consequently, he concludes, Observation,
Tradition (religious), and Reason, all three, show him
“that the greatest welfare of man, towards which all men
aspire, can only be obtained by perfect union and concord
among men.” All three show that the immediate work of the
world’s development, in which he is called upon to take part,
is “the substitution of union and harmony for division and
discord.” “The inner tendency of that spiritual being—love—which
is in the process of birth within him, impels him in
the same direction.”</p>

<p>Union and harmony, and steady, relentless effort to promote
them, which means not only <i>all</i> the work required for
supporting one’s life, but work also for increasing universal
welfare—these are, then, the two final accords in which all
the discords, all the storms, which for more than twenty years
had raged in the distraught mind of the great artist, all the
religious ecstasies and the rationalistic doubts which had
agitated his superior intelligence in its insistent search for
truth finally found their solution. On the highest metaphysical
heights the striving of every living being for its own welfare,
which is Egoism and Love at the same time because it is
Self-Love, and rational Self-Love must embrace all congeners
of the same species—this striving for individual welfare by
its very nature tends to comprise all that exists. “It expands
its limits naturally by love, first for one’s family—one’s wife
and children—then for friends, then for one’s fellow-countrymen;
but Love is not satisfied with this, and tends to embrace
all” (<i>ibid.</i>, §46).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<h3>MAIN POINTS OF THE CHRISTIAN ETHICS</h3>

<p>The central point of the Christian teaching Tolstóy sees
in non-resistance. During the first years after his crisis he
preached absolute “non-resistance to evil”—in full conformity
with the verbal and definite sense of the words of the
gospel, which words, taken in connection with the sentence
about the right and the left cheek, evidently mean complete
humility and resignation. However, he must have soon
realised that such a teaching not only was not in conformity
with his above-mentioned conception of God, but that it also
amounted simply to abetting evil. It contains precisely that
license to evil which always has been preached by the State
religions in the interest of the ruling classes, and Tolstóy
must have realised this. He tells us how he once met in a
train the Governor of the Túla province at the head of a
detachment of soldiers who were armed with rifles and provided
with a cart-load of birch-rods. They were going to
flog the peasants of a village in order to enforce an act of
sheer robbery passed by the Administration in favour of the
landlord and in open breach of the law. He describes with
his well-known graphical powers how, in their presence, a
“Liberal lady” openly, loudly and in strong terms condemned
the Governor and the officers, and how they were
ashamed. Then he describes how, when such an expedition
began its work, the peasants, with truly Christian resignation,
would cross themselves with trembling hand and lie down on
the ground, to be martyrised and flogged till the heart of the
victim stopped beating, without the officers having been
touched in the least by that Christian humility. What Tolstóy
did when he met the expedition, we don’t know: he does
not tell us. He probably remonstrated with the chiefs and
advised the soldiers not to obey them—that is, to revolt. At
any rate, he must have felt that a passive attitude in the face
of this evil—the non-resistance to it—would have meant a
tacit approval of the evil; it would have meant giving support
to it. Moreover, a passive attitude of resignation in the face
of evil is so contrary to the very nature of Tolstóy, that he
could not remain for a long time a follower of such a doctrine,
and he soon altered his interpretation of the text of the gospel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
in the sense of: “Don’t resist evil by violence.” All his later
writings have consequently been <i>a passionate resistance
against the different forms of evil</i> which he has seen round
about himself in the world. Continually he makes his mighty
voice resound against both evil and evil-doers; he only
objects to physical force in resisting evil because he believes
that works harm.</p>

<p>The other four points of the Christian teaching, always
according to Tolstóy’s interpretation of it, are: Do not be
angry, or, at least, abstain from anger as much as you can:
Remain true to the one woman with whom you have
united your life, and avoid all that excites passion: Do not
take oaths, which in Tolstóy’s opinion means: Never tie your
hands with an oath; oath-taking is the means resorted to by
all governments to bind men in their <i>consciences</i> to do whatever
they bid them do; and finally, Love your enemies; or, as
Tolstóy points it out in several of his writings: Never judge,
and never prosecute another before a tribunal.</p>

<p>To these five rules Tolstóy gives the widest possible interpretation
and he deducts from them all the teachings of free
communism. He proves with a wealth of arguments that to
live upon the work of others, and not to earn one’s own living,
is to break the very law of all nature; it is the main cause of
all social evils, as also of nearly all personal unhappiness
and discomforts. He shows how the present capitalistic
organisation of labour is as bad as slavery or serfdom has
ever been.</p>

<p>He insists upon the simplification of life—in food, dress,
and dwelling—which results from one’s taking to manual
work, especially on the land, and shows the advantages
that even the rich and idle of to-day would find in such
labour. He shows how all the evils of present misgovernment
result from the fact that the very men who protest against
bad government make every effort to become a part of that
government.</p>

<p>As emphatically as he protests against the Church, he
protests against the State, as the only real means for bringing
to an end the present slavery imposed upon men by this
institution. He advises men to refuse having anything to do
with the State. And finally, he proves with a wealth of illustrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
in which his artistic powers appear in full, that the
lust of the rich classes for wealth and luxury—a lust which
has no limits, and can have none—is what maintains all this
slavery, all these abnormal conditions of life, and all the
prejudices and teachings now disseminated by Church and
State in the interest of the ruling classes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, whenever he speaks of God, or of
immortality, his constant desire is to show that he needs none
of the mystical conceptions and metaphysical words which are
usually resorted to. And while his language is borrowed from
religious writings, he always brings forward, again and again,
the rationalistic interpretation of religious conceptions. He
carefully sifts from the Christian teaching all that cannot be
accepted by followers of other religions, and brings into relief
all that is common to Christianity as well as to other positive
religions; all that is simply humane in them and thus might be
approved by reason, and therefore be accepted by disbelievers
as well as by believers.</p>

<p>In other words, in proportion as he has lately studied the
teachings of different founders of religions and those of
moral philosophers, he has tried to determine and to state
<i>the elements of a universal religion</i> in which all men could
unite—a religion, however, which would have nothing supernatural
in it, nothing that reason and knowledge would have
to reject, but would contain a moral guidance for all men—at
whatever stage of intellectual development they may halt.
Having thus begun, in 1875-77, by joining the Greek Orthodox
religion—in the sense in which Russian peasants understand
it—he came finally in <i>The Christian Teaching</i> to the
construction of a Moral Philosophy which, in his opinion,
might be accepted by the Christian, the Jew, the Mussulman,
the Buddhist, and so on, and the naturalist philosopher as
well—a religion which would retain the only substantial elements
of all religions: namely, a determination of one’s <i>relation
towards the universe</i> (<i>Weltanschaung</i>), in accordance
with present knowledge, and <i>a recognition of the equality of
all men</i>.</p>

<p>Whether these two elements, one of which belongs to the
domain of knowledge and science and the other (justice) to
the domain of ethics, are sufficient to constitute a <i>religion</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and need no substratum of mysticism—is a question which
lies beyond the scope of this book.</p>

<h3>LATEST WORKS OF ART</h3>

<p>The disturbed conditions of the civilised world, and
especially of Russia, have evidently more than once attracted
the attention of Tolstóy, and induced him to publish a considerable
number of letters, papers, and appeals on various
subjects. In all of them he advocates, first of all, and above
all, an attitude of negation towards Church and State. Never
enter the service of the State, even in the provincial and
urban institutions, which are granted by the State only as a
snare. Refuse to support exploitation in any form. Refuse to
perform military service, whatever the consequences may be:
for this is the only method of being truly anti-militarist.
Never have anything to do with Courts, even if you are
offended or assailed;—nothing but evil results from them.
Such a negative and eminently sincere attitude, he maintains,
would better promote the cause of true progress than any
revolutionary means. As a first step, however, towards the
abolition of modern slavery, he also recommends the nationalisation,
or rather the municipalisation, of land.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the works of art which he wrote during
the last five-and-twenty years, after 1876, must bear deep
traces of his new point of view. He began, first, by writing for
the people, and although most of his small stories for popular
reading are spoiled to some extent by the too obvious desire
of drawing a certain moral, and a consequent distortion of
facts, there are a few among them—especially <i>How much
Land is required for a Man</i>—which are wonderfully artistic.
<i>The Death of Iván Illýtch</i> need only be named to recall the
profound impression produced by its appearance.</p>

<p>In order to speak to a still wider audience in the theatres
for the people, which began to be started in Russia about that
time, he wrote <i>The Power of Darkness</i>,—a most terrible
drama from the life of the peasants, in which he aimed at
producing a deep impression by means of a Shakespearian or
rather Marlowian realism. His other play—<i>The Fruits of
Civilisation</i>—is in a comical vein. The superstitions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
“upper classes” as regards spiritualism are ridiculed in it.
Both plays (the former—with alterations in the final scene)
are played with success on the Russian stage.</p>

<p>However, it is not only the novels and dramas of this
period which are works of Art. The five religious works
which have been named on a preceding page are also works
of art in the best sense of the word, as they contain descriptive
pages of a high artistic value; while the very ways in
which Tolstóy explains the economical principles of Socialism,
or the No-Government principles of Anarchism, are as
much masterpieces as the best socialistic and anarchistic pages
of William Morris—far surpassing the latter in simplicity
and artistic power.</p>

<p><i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> is surely, after <i>Anna Karénina</i>, the work
of Tolstóy which has been the most widely read. However,
the strange theme of this novel and the crusade against
marriage altogether which it contains so much attract the
attention of the reader and usually become the subject of so
passionate a discussion among those who have read it, that
the high artistic qualities of this novel and the analysis
of life which it contains have hardly received the recognition
they deserve. The moral teaching that Tolstóy has put in
<i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> hardly need be mentioned, the more so since
the author himself has withdrawn it to a very great extent.
But for the appreciation of Tolstóy’s work and for the
comprehension of the artist’s inner life this novel has
a deep meaning. No stronger accusation against marriage
for mere outer attraction, without intellectual union or sympathy
of purpose between husband and wife, has ever been
written; and the struggle that goes on between Kóznysheff
and his wife is one of the most deeply dramatic pages of
married life that we possess in any literature.</p>

<p>Tolstóy’s <i>What is Art?</i> is mentioned in Chapter VIII. of
this book. His greatest production of the latest period is,
however, <i>Resurrection</i>. It is not enough to say that the energy
and youthfulness of the septuagenarian author which appear
in this novel are simply marvellous. Its absolute artistic
qualities are so high that if Tolstóy had written nothing else
but <i>Resurrection</i> he would have been recognised as one of
the great writers. All those parts of the novel which deal with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Society, beginning with the letter of “Missie,” and Missie
herself, her father, and so on, are of the same high standard
as the best pages of the first volume of <i>War and Peace</i>.
Everything which deals with the Court, the jurymen, and the
prisons is again of the same high standard. It may be said,
of course, that the principal hero, Neklúdoff, is not sufficiently
living; but this is quite unavoidable for a figure which is meant
to represent, if not the author himself, at least his ideas or
his experience: this is a drawback of all novels containing so
much of an autobiographical element. As regards all the
other figures, however, of which so immense a number pass
under our eyes, each of them has its own character in striking
relief, even if the figure (like one of the judges or of the
jurymen, or the daughter of a jailer) appears only on a
single page, never to reappear again.</p>

<p>The number of questions which are raised in this novel—social,
political, party questions, and so on—is so great that
a whole society, such as it is, living and throbbing with all its
problems and contradictions, appears before the reader, and
this is not Russian Society only, but Society the civilised world
over. In fact, apart from the scenes which deal with the
political prisoners, <i>Resurrection</i> applies to all nations. It is
the most international of all works of Tolstóy. At the same
time the main question: “Has Society the right to judge?
Is it reasonable in maintaining a system of tribunals and
prisons?” this terrible question which the coming century is
bound to solve, is so forcibly impressed upon the reader that
it is impossible to read the book without, at least, conceiving
serious doubts about our system of punishments. <i>Ce livre
pèsera sur la conscience du siècle.</i> (“This book will weigh
upon the conscience of the century”) was the remark of a
French critic, which I heard repeated. And of the justice
of this remark I have had the opportunity of convincing
myself during my numerous conversations in America with
persons having anything to do with prisons. The book
weighs already on their consciences.</p>

<p>The same remark applies to the whole activity of Tolstóy.
Whether his attempt at impressing upon men the elements
of a universal religion which—he believes—reason trained
by science might accept, and which man might take as guidance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
for his moral life, attaining at the same time towards
the solution of the great social problem and all questions
connected with it—whether this bold attempt be successful
or not, can only be decided by time. But it is absolutely
certain that no man since the times of Rousseau has so
profoundly stirred the human conscience as Tolstóy has
by his moral writings. He has fearlessly stated the moral
aspects of all the burning questions of the day, in a form
so deeply impressive that whoever has read any one of his
writings can no longer forget these questions or set them
aside; one feels the necessity of finding, in one way or
another, some solution. Tolstóy’s influence, consequently, is
not one which may be measured by mere years or decades
of years: it will last long. Nor is it limited to one country
only. In millions of copies his works are read in all languages,
appealing equally to men and women of all classes and all
nations, and everywhere producing the same result. Tolstóy
is now the most loved man—the most touchingly loved man—in
the world.</p>

<h3>GONCHARÓFF.</h3>

<p>Goncharóff occupies in Russian literature the
next place after Turguéneff and Tolstóy, but this
extremely interesting writer is almost entirely
unknown to English readers. He was not a prolific writer
and, apart from small sketches, and a book of travel (<i>The
Frigate Pallas</i>), he has left only three novels: <i>A Common
Story</i> (translated into English by Constance Garnett),
<i>Oblómoff</i>, and <i>The Precipice</i>, of which the second, <i>Oblómoff</i>,
has conquered for him a position by the side of the two
great writers just named.</p>

<p>In Russia Goncharóff is always described as a writer of
an eminently objective talent, but this qualification must
evidently be taken with a certain restriction. A writer is never
entirely objective—he has his sympathies and antipathies,
and do what he may, they will appear even through his most
objective descriptions. On the other hand, a good writer
seldom introduces his own individual emotions to speak for
his heroes: there is none of this in either Turguéneff or Tolstóy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
However, with Turguéneff and Tolstóy you feel that
they live with their heroes, that they suffer and feel happy
with them—that they are in love when the hero is in love,
and that they feel miserable when misfortunes befall him;
but you do not feel that to the same extent with Goncharóff.
Surely he has lived through every feeling of his heroes, but
the attitude he tries to preserve towards them is an attitude
of strict impartiality—an attitude, I hardly need say, which,
properly speaking, a writer can never maintain. An epic
repose and an epic profusion of details certainly characterise
Goncharóff’s novels; but these details are not obtrusive, they
do not diminish the impression, and the reader’s interest in
the hero is not distracted by all these minutiæ, because, under
Goncharóff’s pen, they never appear insignificant. One feels,
however, that the author is a person who takes human life
quietly, and will never give way to a burst of passion, whatsoever
may happen to his heroes.</p>

<p>The most popular of the novels of Goncharóff is <i>Oblómoff</i>,
which, like Turguéneff’s <i>Fathers and Sons</i>, and Tolstóy’s
<i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Resurrection</i>, is, I venture to say, one
of the profoundest productions of the last half century. It
is thoroughly Russian, so Russian indeed that only a Russian
can fully appreciate it; but it is at the same time universally
human, as it introduces a type which is almost as universal
as that of Hamlet or Don Quixote.</p>

<p>Oblómoff is a Russian nobleman, of moderate means—the
owner of six or seven hundred serfs—and the time of action
is, let us say, in the fifties of the nineteenth century. All the
early childhood of Oblómoff was such as to destroy in him
any capacity of initiative. Imagine a spacious, well-kept
nobleman’s estate in the middle of Russia, somewhere on
the picturesque banks of the Vólga, at a time when there
were no railways to disturb a peaceful patriarchal life, and no
“questions” that could worry the minds of its inhabitants.
A “reign of plenty,” both for the owners of the estate and
the scores of their servants and retainers, characterises their
life. Nurses, servants, serving boys and maids surround the
child from its earliest days, their only thoughts being how
to feed it, make it grow, render it strong, and never worry
it with either much learning or, in fact, with any sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
work. “From my earliest childhood, have I myself ever put
on my socks?” Oblómoff asks later on. In the morning, the
coming mid-day meal is the main question for all the household;
and when the dinner is over, at an early hour of the
day, sleep—a reign of sleep, sleep rising to an epical degree
which implies full loss of consciousness for all the inhabitants
of the mansion and its dependencies—spreads its wings for
several hours from the bedchamber of the landlord even as
far as the remotest corner of the retainers’ dwellings.</p>

<p>In these surroundings Oblómoff’s childhood and youth
were passed. Later on, he enters the University; but his trustworthy
servants follow him to the capital, and the lazy,
sleepy atmosphere of his native ‘Oblómovka’ (the estate)
holds him even there in its enchanted arms. A few lectures
at the university, some elevating talk with a young friend in
the evening, some vague aspiration towards the ideal, occasionally
stir the young man’s heart; and a beautiful vision
begins to rise before his eyes—these things are certainly a
necessary accompaniment of the years spent at the university;
but the soothing, soporific influence of Oblómovka, its
quietness and laziness, its feeling of a fully guaranteed, undisturbed
existence, deaden even these impressions of youth.
Other students grow hot in their discussions, and join
“circles.” Oblómoff looks quietly at all that and asks himself:
“What is it for?” And then, the moment that the young
student has returned home after his university years, the
same atmosphere again envelops him. “Why should you
think and worry yourself with this or that?” Leave that
to “others.” Have you not there your old nurse, thinking
whether there is anything else she might do for your
comfort?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My people did not let me have even a wish,” Goncharóff wrote
in his short autobiography, from which we discovered the close connection
between the author and his hero: “all had been foreseen and
attended to long since. The old servants, with my nurse at their head,
looked into my eyes to guess my wishes, trying to remember what I
liked best when I was with them, where my writing table ought to
be put, which chair I preferred to the others, how to make my bed.
The cook tried to remember which dishes I had liked in my childhood—and
all could not admire me enough.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Such was Oblómoff’s youth, and such was to a very great
extent Goncharóff’s youth and character as well.</p>

<p>The novel begins with Oblómoff’s morning in his lodgings
at St. Petersburg. It is late, but he is still in bed; several
times already he has tried to get up, several times his foot
was in the slipper; but, after a moment’s reflection, he has
returned under his blankets. His trusty Zakhár—his old faithful
servant who formerly had carried him as a baby in his
arms—is by his side, and brings him his glass of tea. Visitors
come in; they try to induce Oblómoff to go out, to take a
drive to the yearly First of May promenade; but—“What
for?” he asks. “For what should I take all this trouble, and
do all this moving about?” And he remains in bed.</p>

<p>His only trouble is that the landlord wants him to leave
the lodgings which he occupies. The rooms are dull, dusty—Zakhár
is no great admirer of cleanliness; but to change
lodgings is such a calamity for Oblómoff that he tries to
avoid it by all possible means, or at least to postpone it.</p>

<p>Oblómoff is very well educated, well-bred, he has a refined
taste, and in matters of art he is a fine judge. Everything
that is vulgar is repulsive to him. He never will commit
any dishonest act; he cannot. He also shares the highest
and noblest aspirations of his contemporaries. Like many
others, he is ashamed of being a serf-owner, and he has in
his head a certain scheme which he is going to put some
day into writing—a scheme which, if it is only carried out,
will surely improve the condition of his peasants and eventually
free them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The joy of higher inspirations was accessible to him”—Goncharóff
writes; “the miseries of mankind were not strange to him.
Sometimes he cried bitterly in the depths of his heart about human
sorrows. He felt unnamed, unknown sufferings and sadness, and a
desire of going somewhere far away,—probably into that world
towards which his friend Stoltz had tried to take him in his younger
days. Sweet tears would then flow upon his cheeks. It would also
happen that he would himself feel hatred towards human vices,
towards deceit, towards the evil which is spread all over the world;
and he would then feel the desire to show mankind its diseases.
Thoughts would then burn within him, rolling in his head like
waves in the sea; they would grow into decisions which would make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
all his blood boil; his muscles would be ready to move, his sinews
would be strained, intentions would be on the point of transforming
themselves into decisions.... Moved by a moral force he
would rapidly change over and over again his position in his bed;
with a fixed stare he would half lift himself from it, move his hand,
look about with inspired eyes ... the inspiration would
seem ready to realise itself, to transform itself into an act of heroism,
and then, what miracles, what admirable results might one not expect
from so great an effort! But—the morning would pass away, the
shades of evening would take the place of the broad daylight, and with
them the strained forces of Oblómoff would incline towards rest—the
storms in his soul would subside—his head would shake off the
worrying thoughts—his blood would circulate more slowly in his
veins—and Oblómoff would slowly turn over, and recline on his
back; looking sadly through his window upon the sky, following sadly
with his eyes the sun which was setting gloriously behind the neighbouring
house—and how many times had he thus followed with his
eyes that sunset!”</p>
</div>

<p>In such lines as these Goncharóff depicts the state of
inactivity into which Oblómoff had fallen at the age of about
thirty-five. It is the supreme poetry of laziness—a laziness
created by a whole life of old-time landlordism.</p>

<p>Oblómoff, as I just said, is very uncomfortable in his
lodgings; moreover, the landlord, who intends to make some
repairs in the house, wants him to leave; but for Oblómoff
to change his lodgings is something so terrific, so extraordinary,
that he tries by all sorts of artifices to postpone the
undesirable moment. His old Zakhár tries to convince him
that they cannot remain any longer in that house, and ventures
the unfortunate word, that, after all, “others” move
when they have to.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I thought,” he said, “that others are not worse than we are, and
that they move sometimes; so we could move, too.”</p>

<p>“What, what?” exclaimed Oblómoff, rising from his easy chair,
“what is it that you say?”</p>

<p>Zakhár felt very ashamed. He could not understand what had
provoked the reproachful exclamation of his master, and did not
reply.</p>

<p>“Others are not worse than we are!” repeated Iliyá Iliych (Oblómoff)
with a sense of horror. “That is what you have come to. Now
I shall know henceforth that I am for you the same as ‘the others’.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>After a time Oblómoff calls Zakhár back and has with him
an explanation which is worth reproducing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Have you ever thought what it meant—‘the others,’” Oblómoff
began. “Must I tell you what this means?”</p>

<p>Poor Zakhár shifted about uneasily, like a bear in his den, and
sighed aloud.</p>

<p>“‘Another’—that means a wild, uneducated man; he lives poorly,
dirtily, in an attic; he can sleep on a piece of felt stretched somewhere
on the floor—what does that matter to him?—Nothing! He will feed
on potatoes and herrings; misery compels him continuously to shift
from one place to another. He runs about all day long—<i>he</i>, he may,
of course, go to new lodgings. There is Lagáeff; he takes under his
arm his ruler and his two shirts wrapped in a handkerchief, and he
is off. ‘Where are you going?’ you ask him.—‘I am moving’, he
says. That is what ‘the others’ means.—Am I one of those others,
do you mean?”</p>

<p>Zakhár threw a glance upon his master, shifted from one foot to
the other, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Do you understand now what ‘another’ means?” continued
Oblómoff. “‘Another,’ that is the man who cleans his own boots,
who himself puts on his clothes—without any help! Of course, he
may sometimes look like a gentleman, but that is mere deceit: he does
not know what it means to have a servant—he has nobody to send to
the shop to make his purchases; he makes them himself—he will even
poke his own fire, and occasionally use a duster.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Zakhár sternly, “there are many such people
among the Germans.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it! And I? do you think that I am one of
them?”</p>

<p>“No, you are different,” Zakhár said, still unable to understand
what his master was driving at.... “But God knows what is
coming upon you....”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am different! Most certainly, I am. Do I run about? do
I work? don’t I eat whenever I am hungry? Look at me—am I thin?
am I sickly to look at? Is there anything I lack? Thank God, I have
people to do things for me. I have never put on my own socks since
I was born, thank God! Must I also be restless like the others?—What
for?—And to whom am I saying all this? Have you not been
with me from childhood?... You have seen it all. You know
that I have received a delicate education; that I have never suffered
from cold or from hunger,—never knew want—never worked
for my own bread—have never done any sort of dirty work....
Well, how dare you put me on the same level as the ‘others’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>Later on, when Zakhár brought him a glass of water, “No, wait
a moment,” Oblómoff said. “I ask you, How did you dare to so deeply
offend your master, whom you carried in your arms while he was a
baby, whom you have served all your life, and who has always been
a benefactor to you?” Zakhár could not stand it any longer—the
word benefactor broke him down—he began to blink. The less he
understood the speech of Iliyá Iliych, the more sad he felt. Finally,
the reproachful words of his master made him break into tears, while
Iliyá Iliych seizing this pretext for postponing his letter-writing till
to-morrow, tells Zakhár, “you had better pull the blinds down and
cover me nicely, and see that nobody disturbs me. Perhaps I may sleep
for an hour or so, and at half past five wake me for dinner.”</p>
</div>

<p>About this time Oblómoff meets a young girl, Olga, who
is perhaps one of the finest representatives of Russian women
in our novels. A mutual friend, Stoltz, has said much to her
about Oblómoff—about his talents and possibilities, and also
about the laziness of his life, which would surely ruin him
if it continued. Women are always ready to undertake rescue
work, and Olga tries to draw Oblómoff out of his sleepy,
vegetative existence. She sings beautifully, and Oblómoff,
who is a great lover of music, is deeply moved by her
songs.</p>

<p>Gradually Olga and Oblómoff fall in love with each other,
and she tries to shake off his laziness, to arouse him to higher
interests in life. She insists that he shall finish the great
scheme for the improvement of his peasant serfs upon which
he is supposed to have been working for years. She tries
to awaken in him an interest for art and literature, to create
for him a life in which his gifted nature shall find a field
of activity. It seems at first as if the vigour and charm of
Olga are going to renovate Oblómoff by insensible steps. He
wakes up, he returns to life. The love of Olga for Oblómoff,
which is depicted in its development with a mastery almost
equalling that of Turguéneff, grows deeper and deeper, and
the inevitable next step—marriage—is approaching....
But this is enough to frighten away Oblómoff. To take this
step he would have to bestir himself, to go to his estate, to
break the lazy monotony of his life, and this is too much
for him. He lingers and hesitates to make the first necessary
steps. He postpones them from day to day, and finally he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
falls back into his Oblómoffdom, and returns to his sofa, his
dressing gown, and his slippers. Olga is ready to do the
impossible; she tries to carry him away by her love and her
energy; but she is forced to realise that all her endeavours
are useless, and that she has trusted too much to her own
strength: the disease of Oblómoff is incurable. She has to
abandon him, and Goncharóff describes their parting in a
most beautiful scene, from which I will give here a few of
the concluding passages:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Then we must part?” she said.... “If we married,
what would come next?” He replied nothing. “You would fall asleep,
deeper and deeper every day—is it not so? And I—you see what I
am—I shall not grow old, I shall never be tired of life. We should
live from day to day and year to year, looking forward to Christmas,
and then to the Carnival; we should go to parties, dance, and think
about nothing at all. We should lie down at night thanking God
that one day has passed, and next morning we should wake up with
the desire that to-day may be like yesterday; that would be our future,
is it not so? But is that life? I should wither under it—I should die.
And for what, Iliyá? Could I make you happy?”</p>

<p>He cast his eyes around and tried to move, to run away, but his
feet would not obey him. He wanted to say something, but his mouth
was dry, his tongue motionless, his voice would not come out of his
throat. He moved his hand towards her, then he began something,
with lowered voice, but could not finish it, and with his look he said
to her, “Good-bye—farewell.”</p>

<p>She also wanted to say something, but could not—moved her hand
in his direction, but before it had reached his it dropped. She wanted
to say “Farewell,” but her voice broke in the middle of the word and
took a false accent. Then her face quivered, she put her hand and her
head on his shoulder and cried. It seemed now as if all her weapons
had been taken out of her hand—reasoning had gone—there remained
only the woman, helpless against her sorrow. “Farewell, Farewell”
came out of her sobbings....</p>

<p>“No,” said Olga, trying to look upon him through her tears, “it is
only now that I see that I loved in you what I wanted you to be, I
loved the future Oblómoff. You are good, honest, Iliyá, you are tender
as a dove, you put your head under your wing and want nothing more,
you are ready all your life to coo under a roof ... but I am not
so, that would be too little for me. I want something more—what, I
do not know; can you tell me what it is that I want? give me it, that
I should.... As to sweetness, there is plenty of it everywhere.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>They part, Olga passes through a severe illness, and a
few months later we see Oblómoff married to the landlady
of his rooms, a very respectable person with beautiful elbows,
and a great master in kitchen affairs and household work
generally. As to Olga, she marries Stoltz later on. But this
Stoltz is rather a symbol of intelligent industrial activity
than a living man. He is invented, and I pass him by.</p>

<p>The impression which this novel produced in Russia, on
its appearance in 1859, was indescribable. It was a far
greater event than the appearance of a new work by Turguéneff.
All educated Russia read <i>Oblómoff</i> and discussed
“Oblómoffdom.” Everyone recognised something of himself
in Oblómoff, felt the disease of Oblómoff in his own veins.
As to Olga, thousands of young people fell in love with
her: her favourite song, the “Casta Diva,” became their
favourite melody. And now, forty years afterwards, one can
read and re-read “Oblómoff” with the same pleasure as
nearly half a century ago, and it has lost nothing of its
meaning, while it has acquired many new ones: there are
always living Oblómoffs.</p>

<p>At the time of the appearance of this novel “Oblómoffdom”
became a current word to designate the state of
Russia. All Russian life, all Russian history, bears traces of
the malady—that laziness of mind and heart, that right
to laziness proclaimed as a virtue, that conservatism and
inertia, that contempt of feverish activity, which characterise
Oblómoff and were so much cultivated in serfdom times,
even amongst the best men in Russia—and even among the
malcontents. “A sad result of serfdom”—it was said then.
But, as we live further away from serfdom times, we begin
to realise that Oblómoff is not dead amongst us: that serfdom
is not the only thing which creates this type of men,
but that the very conditions of wealthy life, the routine of
civilised life, contribute to maintain it.</p>

<p>“A racial feature, distinctive of the Russian race,” others
said; and they were right, too, to a great extent. The absence
of a love for struggle; the “let me alone” attitude, the want
of “aggressive” virtue; non-resistance and passive submission—these
are to a great extent distinctive features of
the Russian race. And this is probably why a Russian writer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
has so well pictured the type. But with all that, the Oblómoff
type is not limited to Russia: It is a universal type—a type
which is nurtured by our present civilisation, amidst its
opulent, self-satisfied life. It is the conservative type. Not
in the political sense, but in the sense of the conservatism
of well-being. A man who has reached a certain welfare or
has got it by inheritance is not willingly moved to undertake
anything new, because it might mean introducing something
unpleasant and full of worries into his quiet and
smooth existence. Therefore he lingers in a life devoid of
the true impulses of real life, from fear that these might
disturb the quietness of his vegetative existence.</p>

<p>Oblómoff knows the value of Art and its impulses; he
knows the higher enthusiasms of poetical love: he has felt
both. But—“What is the use?” he asks again. “Why all
this trouble of going about and seeing people? What is it
for?” He is not a Diogenes who has no needs. Far from
that. If his meat be served too dry and his fowl be burned,
he resents it. It is the higher interests which he thinks not
worth the trouble they occasion. When he was young he
thought of setting his serfs free—in such a way that the
step should not much diminish his income. But gradually
he has forgotten all about that, and now his main thought
is, how to shake off all the worries of the management of
his estate. “I don’t know”—he says—“what obligatory
work is, what is farmer’s work, what ownership means, what
a poor farmer is and what a rich one; what makes a quarter
of wheat, when wheat has to be sown and reaped, or when it
has to be sold.” And when he dreams of country life on his
estate he thinks of pretty greenhouses, of picnics in the woods,
of idyllic walks in company with a goodly, submissive and
plump wife, who looks into his eyes and worships him. The
question of why and how all this wealth comes to him, and
why all these people must work for him, never worries his
mind. But—how many of those all over the world, who own
factories, wheat fields and coal mines, or hold shares in them,
ever think of mines, wheat fields and factories otherwise than
in the way Oblómoff thought of his country seat—that is, in
an idyllic contemplation of how others work, without the
slightest intention of sharing their burdens?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>The city-bred Oblómoffs may take the place of the country-bred,
but the type remains. And then comes the long succession
of Oblómoffs in intellectual, social, nay even in personal,
life. Everything new in the domain of the intellect makes
them restless, and they are only satisfied when all men have
accepted the same ideas. They are suspicious of social reform,
because the very suggestion of a change frightens them. Love
itself frightens them. Oblómoff is loved by Olga; he, too,
loves her; but to take that step—marriage—frightens him.
She is too restless. She wants him to go about and to see
pictures; to read and to discuss this and that; to throw him
into the whirl of life. She loves him so much that she is ready
to follow him without asking any questions. But this very
power of love, this very intensity of life, frightens an
Oblómoff.</p>

<p>He tries to find pretexts for avoiding this irruption of
life into his vegetative existence; he prizes so much his
little material comfort that he dares not love—dares not take
love with all its consequences—“its tears, its impulses, its
life,” and soon falls back into his cosy Oblómoffdom.</p>

<p>Decidedly, Oblómoffdom is not a racial disease. It exists
on both continents and in all latitudes. And besides the
Oblómoffdom which Goncharóff has so well depicted, and
which even Olga was powerless to break through, there is the
squire’s Oblómoffdom, the red-tape Oblómoffdom of the
Government offices, the scientist’s Oblómoffdom and, above
all, the family-life Oblómoffdom, to which all of us readily
pay so large a tribute.</p>

<h3>THE PRECIPICE</h3>

<p>The last and longest novel of Goncharóff, <i>The Precipice</i>,
has not the unity of conception and workmanship which
characterise <i>Oblómoff</i>. It contains wonderful pages, worthy
of a writer of genius; but, all said, it is a failure. It took
Goncharóff full ten years to write it, and having begun to
depict in it types of one generation, he remodelled later on
these types into types from the next generation—at a time
when the sons differed totally from their fathers: he has
told this himself in a very interesting critical sketch of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
own work. As a result there is no wholeness, so to speak,
in the main personages of the novel. The woman upon
whom he has bestowed all his admiration, Vyéra, and
whom he tries to represent as most sympathetic, is certainly
interesting, but not sympathetic at all. One would say that
Goncharóff’s mind was haunted by two women of two totally
different types when he pictured his Vyéra—the one whom
he tried—and failed—to picture in Sophie Byelovódova,
and the other—the coming woman of the sixties, of whom he
saw some features, and whom he admired, without fully
understanding her. Vyéra’s cruelty towards her grandmother,
and towards Ráisky, the hero, render her most unsympathetic,
although you feel that the author quite adores her. As
to the Nihilist, Vólokhoff, he is simply a caricature—taken
perhaps from real life,—even seemingly from among the
author’s personal acquaintances,—but obviously drawn with
the desire of ventilating personal feelings of dislike. One
feels a personal drama concealed behind the pages of the
novel. Goncharóff’s first sketch of Vólokhoff was, as he
wrote himself, some sort of Bohemian Radical of the forties
who had retained in full the Don Juanesque features of the
“Byronists” of the preceding generation. Gradually, however,
Goncharóff, who had not yet finished his novel by the
end of the fifties, transformed the figure into a Nihilist of the
sixties—a revolutionist—and the result is that one has
the sensation of the double origin of Vólokhoff, as one feels
the double origin of Vyéra.</p>

<p>The only figure of the novel really true to life is the grandmother
of Vyéra. This is an admirably painted figure of the
simple, commonsense, independent woman of old Russia,
while Martha, the sister of Vyéra, is an excellent picture of
the commonplace girl, full of life, respectful of old traditions—to
be one day the honest and reliable mother of a family.
These two figures are the work of a great artist; but all the
other figures are made-up, and consequently are failures; and
yet there is much exaggeration in the tragical way in which
Vyéra’s fall is taken by her grandmother. As to the background
of the novel—the estate on a precipice leading to the
Vólga—it is one of the most beautiful landscapes in Russian
literature.</p>

<h3>DOSTOYÉVSKIY</h3>

<p>Few authors have been so well received, from their very
first appearance in literature, as Dostoyévskiy was. In 1845
he arrived in St. Petersburg, a quite unknown young man who
only two years before had finished his education in a school
of military engineers, and after having spent two years in
the engineering service had then abandoned it with the intention
of devoting himself to literature. He was only twenty-four
when he wrote his first novel, <i>Poor People</i>, which his
school-comrade, Grigoróvitch, gave to the poet Nekrásoff,
offering it for a literary almanack. Dostoyévskiy had inwardly
doubted whether the novel would even be read by the editor.
He was living then in a poor, miserable room, and was fast
asleep when at four o’clock in the morning Nekrásoff and
Grigoróvitch knocked at his door. They threw themselves on
Dostoyévskiy’s neck, congratulating him with tears in their
eyes. Nekrásoff and his friend had begun to read the novel
late in the evening; they could not stop reading till they came
to the end, and they were both so deeply impressed by it that
they could not help going on this nocturnal expedition, to see
the author and tell him what they felt. A few days later
Dostoyévskiy was introduced to the great critic of the time,
Byelínskiy, and from him he received the same warm reception.
As to the reading public, the novel produced quite a
sensation. The same must be said about all subsequent novels
of Dostoyévskiy. They had an immense sale all over Russia.</p>

<p>The life of Dostoyévskiy was extremely sad. In the year
1849, four years after he had won his first success with <i>Poor
People</i>, he became mixed up in the affairs of some Fourierists
(members of the circles of Petrashévskiy), who used to meet
together to read the works of Fourier, commenting on them,
and talking about the necessity of a Socialistic movement in
Russia. At one of these gatherings Dostoyévskiy read, and
copied later on, a certain letter from Byelínskiy to Gógol, in
which the great critic spoke in rather sharp language about
the Russian Church and the State; he also took part in a meeting
at which the starting of a secret printing office was discussed.
He was arrested, tried (of course with closed doors),
and, with several others, was condemned to death. In December,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
1849, he was taken to a public square, placed on the scaffold,
under a gibbet, to listen there to a profusedly-worded
death-sentence, and only at the last moment came a messenger
from Nicholas I., bringing a pardon. Three days later he was
transported to Siberia and locked up in a hard-labour prison
at Omsk. There he remained for four years, when owing to
some influence at St. Petersburg he was liberated, only to be
made a soldier. During his detention in the hard-labour prison
he was submitted, for some minor offence, to the terrible
punishment of the cat-o’-nine-tails, and from that time dates
his disease—epilepsy—which he never quite got rid of during
all his life. The coronation amnesty of Alexander II. did not
improve Dostoyévskiy’s fate. Not until 1859—four years
after the advent of Alexander II. to the throne—was the
great writer pardoned and allowed to return to Russia. He
died in 1883.</p>

<p>Dostoyévskiy was a rapid writer, and even before his
arrest he had published ten novels, of which <i>The Double</i> was
already a forerunner of his later psycho-pathological novels,
and <i>Nétochka Nezvánova</i> showed a rapidly maturing literary
talent of the highest quality. On his return from Siberia he
began publishing a series of novels which produced a deep
impression on the reading public. He opened the series by
a great novel, <i>The Downtrodden and Offended</i>, which was
soon followed by <i>Memoirs from a Dead-House</i>, in which he
described his hard-labour experience. Then came an extremely
sensational novel, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, which lately was
widely read all over Europe and America. <i>The Brothers
Karamázoff</i>, which is considered his most elaborate work, is
even more sensational, while <i>The Youth</i>, <i>The Idiot</i>, <i>The
Devils</i> are a series of shorter novels devoted to the same
psycho-pathological problems.</p>

<p>If Dostoyévskiy’s work had been judged from the purely
æsthetic point of view, the verdict of critics concerning its
literary value would have been anything but flattering.
Dostoyévskiy wrote with such rapidity and he so little cared
about the working out of his novels, that, as Dobrolúboff
has shown, the literary form is in many places almost below
criticism. His heroes speak in a slipshod way, continually
repeating themselves, and whatever hero appears in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
novel (especially is this so in <i>The Downtrodden</i>), you feel it
is the author who speaks. Besides, to these serious defects one
must add the extremely romantic and obsolete forms of the
plots of his novels, the disorder of their construction, and
the unnatural succession of their events—to say nothing of the
atmosphere of the lunatic asylum with which the later ones
are permeated. And yet, with all this, the works of Dostoyévskiy
are penetrated with such a deep feeling of reality, and by
the side of the most unreal characters one finds characters so
well known to every one of us, and so real, that all these
defects are redeemed. Even when you think that Dostoyévskiy’s
record of the conversations of his heroes is not correct,
you feel that the men whom he describes—at least some of
them—were exactly such as he wanted to describe them.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoirs from a Dead-House</i> is the only production
of Dostoyévskiy which can be recognised as truly artistic: its
leading idea is beautiful, and the form is worked out in conformity
with the idea; but in his later productions the author
is so much oppressed by his ideas, all very vague, and grows
so nervously excited over them that he cannot find the
proper form. The favourite themes of Dostoyévskiy are the
men who have been brought so low by the circumstances of
their lives, that they have not even a conception of there
being a possibility of rising above these conditions. You feel
moreover that Dostoyévskiy finds a real pleasure in describing
the sufferings, moral and physical, of the down-trodden—that
he revels in representing that misery of mind,
that absolute hopelessness of redress, and that completely
broken-down condition of human nature which is characteristic
of neuro-pathological cases. By the side of such sufferers
you find a few others who are so deeply human that all your
sympathies go with them; but the favourite heroes of Dostoyévskiy
are the man and the woman who consider themselves
as not having either the force to compel respect, or even
the right of being treated as human beings. They once have
made some timid attempt at defending their personalities, but
they have succumbed, and never will try it again. They will
sink deeper and deeper in their wretchedness, and die, either
from consumption or from exposure, or they will become the
victims of some mental affection—a sort of half-lucid lunacy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
during which man occasionally rises to the highest conceptions
of human philosophy—while some will conceive an
embitterment which will bring them to commit some crime,
followed by repentance the very next instant after it has been
done.</p>

<p>In <i>Downtrodden and Offended</i> we see a young man madly
in love with a girl from a moderately poor family. This girl
falls in love with a very aristocratic prince—a man without
principles, but charming in his childish egotism—extremely
attractive by his sincerity, and with a full capacity for quite
unconsciously committing the worst crimes towards those with
whom life brings him into contact. The psychology of both
the girl and the young aristocrat is very good, but where
Dostoyévskiy appears at his best is in representing how the
other young man, rejected by the girl, devotes the whole of
his existence to being the humble servant of that girl, and
against his own will becomes instrumental in throwing her
into the hands of the young aristocrat. All this is quite possible,
all this exists in life, and it is all told by Dostoyévskiy so
as to make one feel the deepest commiseration with the poor
and the down-trodden; but even in this novel the pleasure
which the author finds in representing the unfathomable submission
and servitude of his heroes, and the pleasure they
find in the very sufferings and the ill-treatment that has been
inflicted upon them—is repulsive to a sound mind.</p>

<p>The next great novel of Dostoyévskiy, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>,
produced quite a sensation. Its hero is a young student,
Raskólnikoff, who deeply loves his mother and his sister—both
extremely poor, like himself—and who, haunted by the
desire of finding some money in order to finish his studies
and to become a support to his dear ones, comes to the idea
of killing an old woman—a private money-lender whom he
knows and who is said to possess a few thousand roubles. A
series of more or less fortuitous circumstances confirms him
in this idea and pushes him this way. Thus, his sister, who sees
no escape from their poverty, is going at last to sacrifice herself
for her family, and to marry a certain despicable, elderly
man with much money, and Raskólnikoff is firmly decided to
prevent this marriage. At the same time he meets with an old
man—a small civil service clerk and a drunkard who has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
most sympathetic daughter from the first marriage, Sónya.
The family are at the lowest imaginable depths of destitution—such
as can only be found in a large city like St. Petersburg,
and Raskólnikoff is brought to take interest in them. Owing
to all these circumstances, while he himself sinks deeper and
deeper into the darkest misery, and realises the depths of
hopeless poverty and misery which surround him, the idea of
killing the old money-lending woman takes a firm hold of
him. He accomplishes the crime and, of course, as might
have been foreseen, does not take advantage of the money:
he even does not find it in his excitement; and, after having
lived for a few days haunted by remorse and shame—again
under the pressure of a series of various circumstances which
add to the feeling of remorse—he goes to surrender himself,
denouncing himself as the murderer of the old woman and
her sister.</p>

<p>This is, of course, only the framework of the novel; in
reality it is full of the most thrilling scenes of poverty on the
one hand and of moral degradation on the other, while a
number of secondary characters—an elderly gentleman in
whose family Raskólnikoff’s sister has been a governess, the
examining magistrate, and so on—are introduced. Besides,
Dostoyévskiy, after having accumulated so many reasons
which might have brought a Raskólnikoff to commit such a
murder, found it necessary to introduce another theoretical
motive. One learns in the midst of the novel that Raskólnikoff,
captivated by the modern, current ideas of materialist
philosophy, has written and published a newspaper article to
prove that men are divided into superior and inferior beings,
and that for the former—Napoleon being a sample of them—the
current rules of morality are not obligatory.</p>

<p>Most of the readers of this novel and most of the literary
critics speak very highly of the psychological analysis of
Raskólnikoff’s soul and of the motives which brought him to
his desperate step. However, I will permit myself to remark
that the very profusion of accidental causes accumulated by
Dostoyévskiy shows how difficult he felt it himself to prove
that the propaganda of materialistic ideas could in reality
bring an honest young man to act as Raskólnikoff did. Raskólnikoffs
do not become murderers under the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
such theoretical considerations, while those who murder and
invoke such motives, like Lebiès at Paris, are not in the least
of the Raskólnikoff type. Behind Raskólnikoff I feel Dostoyévskiy
trying to decide whether he himself, or a man like
him, might have been brought to act as Raskólnikoff did, and
what would be the psychological explanation if he had been
driven to do so. But such men do <i>not</i> murder. Besides,
men like the examining magistrate and M. Swidrigailoff are
purely romantic inventions.</p>

<p>However, with all its faults, the novel produces a most
powerful effect by its real pictures of slum-life, and inspires
every honest reader with the deepest commiseration towards
even the lowest sunken inhabitants of the slums. When Dostoyévskiy
comes to them, he becomes a realist in the very best
sense of the word, like Turguéneff or Tolstóy. Marmeládoff—the
old drunken official—his drunken talk and his death,
his family, and the incidents which happen after his burial,
his wife and his daughter Sónya—all these are living beings
and real incidents of the life of the poorest ones, and the
pages that Dostoyévskiy gave to them belong to the most
impressive and the most moving pages in any literature. They
have the touch of genius.</p>

<p><i>The Brothers Karamázoff</i> is the most artistically worked
out of Dostoyévskiy’s novels, but it is also the novel in which
all the inner defects of the author’s mind and imagination
have found their fullest expression. The philosophy of this
novel—incredulous Western Europe; wildly passionate,
drunken, unreformed Russia; and Russia reformed by creed
and monks—the three represented by the three brothers
Karamázoff—only faintly appears in the background. But
there is certainly not in any literature such a collection of the
most repulsive types of mankind—lunatics, half-lunatics,
criminals in germ and in reality, in all possible gradations—as
one finds in this novel. A Russian specialist in brain and
nervous diseases finds representatives of all sorts of such diseases
in Dostoyévskiy’s novels, and especially in <i>The Brothers
Karamázoff</i>—the whole being set in a frame which represents
the strangest mixture of realism and romanticism run wild.
Whatsoever a certain portion of contemporary critics, fond
of all sorts of morbid literature, may have written about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
novel, the present writer can only say that he finds it, all
through, so unnatural, so much fabricated for the purpose of
introducing—here, a bit of morals, there, some abominable
character taken from a psycho-pathological hospital; or
again, in order to analyse the feelings of some purely imaginary
criminal, that a few good pages scattered here and there
do not compensate the reader for the hard task of reading
these two volumes.</p>

<p>Dostoyévskiy is still very much read in Russia; and when,
some twenty years ago, his novels were first translated into
French, German and English, they were received as a revelation.
He was praised as one of the greatest writers of our
own time, and as undoubtedly the one who “had best
expressed the mystic Slavonic soul”—whatever that expression
may mean! Turguéneff was eclipsed by Dostoyévskiy,
and Tolstóy was forgotten for a time. There was, of course,
a great deal of hysterical exaggeration in all this, and at the
present time sound literary critics do not venture to indulge
in such praises. The fact is, that there is certainly a great
deal of power in whatever Dostoyévskiy wrote: his powers
of creation suggest those of Hoffman; and his sympathy with
the most down-trodden and down-cast products of the civilisation
of our large towns is so deep that it carries away the
most indifferent reader and exercises a most powerful
impression in the right direction upon young readers.
His analysis of the most varied specimens of incipient
psychical disease is said to be thoroughly correct. But with
all that, the artistic qualities of his novels are incomparably
below those of any one of the great Russian masters: Tolstóy,
Turguéneff, or Gontcharóff. Pages of consummate realism
are interwoven with the most fantastical incidents worthy
only of the most incorrigible romantics. Scenes of a thrilling
interest are interrupted in order to introduce a score of pages
of the most unnatural theoretical discussions. Besides, the
author is in such a hurry that he seems never to have had the
time himself to read over his novels before sending them to
the printer. And, worst of all, every one of the heroes of
Dostoyévskiy, especially in his novels of the later period, is
a person suffering from some psychical disease or from moral
perversion. As a result, while one may read some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
novels of Dostoyévskiy with the greatest interest, one is never
tempted to re-read them, as one re-reads the novels of Tolstóy
and Turguéneff, and even those of many secondary novel
writers; and the present writer must confess that he had the
greatest pain lately in reading through, for instance, <i>The
Brothers Karamázoff</i>, and never could pull himself through
such a novel as <i>The Idiot</i>. However, one pardons Dostoyévskiy
everything, because when he speaks of the ill-treated and
forgotten children of our town civilisation he becomes truly
great through his wide, infinite love of mankind—of man,
even in his worst manifestations. Through his love of those
drunkards, beggars, petty thieves and so on, whom we usually
pass by without even bestowing upon them a pitying glance;
through his power of discovering what is human and often
great in the lowest sunken being; through the love which he
inspires in us, even for the least interesting types of mankind,
even for those who never will make an effort to get out of the
low and miserable position into which life has thrown them—through
this faculty Dostoyévskiy has certainly won a
unique position among the writers of modern times, and he
will be read—not for the artistic finish of his writings but for
the good thoughts which are scattered through them, for
their real reproduction of slum life in the great cities—and
for the infinite sympathy which a being like Sónya can inspire
in the reader.</p>

<h3>NEKRÁSOFF</h3>

<p>With Nekrásoff we come to a poet whose work has been
the subject of a lively controversy in Russian Literature. He
was born in 1821—his father being a poor army officer who
married a Polish lady for love. This lady must have been
most remarkable, because in his poems Nekrásoff continually
refers to his mother in accents of love and respect, such as
perhaps have no parallel in any other poet. His mother, however,
died very early, and their large family, which consisted
of thirteen brothers and sisters, must have been in great
straits. No sooner had Nicholas Nekrásoff, the future poet,
attained his sixteenth year, than he left the provincial town
where the family were staying and went to St. Petersburg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
to enter the University, where he joined the philological
department. Most Russian students live very poorly—mostly
by lessons, or entering as tutors in families where they are
paid very little, but have at least lodgings and food. But
Nekrásoff experienced simply black misery: “For full three
years,” he said at a later period, “I felt continually hungry
every day.” “It often happened that I entered one of the great
restaurants where people may go to read newspapers, even
without ordering anything to eat, and while I read my paper
I would draw the bread plate towards myself and eat the
bread, and that was my only food.” At last he fell ill, and
during his convalescence the old soldier from whom he rented
a tiny room, and to whom he had already run into debt, one
cold November night refused to admit his lodger to his
room. Nekrásoff would have had to spend the night out of
doors, but a passing beggar took pity on him and took him to
some slums on the outskirts of the town, to a “doss-house,”
where the young poet found also the possibility of earning
fifteen farthings for some petition that he wrote for one of
the inmates. Such was the youth of Nekrásoff; but during it
he had the opportunity of making acquaintance with the
poorest and lowest classes of St. Petersburg, and the love
towards them which he acquired during these peregrinations
he retained all his life. Later on, by means of relentless work,
and by editing all sorts of almanacks, he improved his material
conditions. He became a regular contributor to the
chief review of the time, for which Turguéneff, Dostoyévskiy,
Hérzen, and all our best writers wrote, and in 1846 he even
became the owner of this review, <i>The Contemporary</i>, which
for the next fifteen years played so important a part in
Russian literature. In <i>The Contemporary</i> he came, in the
sixties, into close contact and friendship with two remarkable
men, Tchernyshévskiy and Dobrolúboff, and about this time
he wrote his best verses. In 1875 he fell seriously ill, and the
next two years his life was simply agony. He died in December,
1877, and thousands of people, especially the University
students, followed his body to the grave.</p>

<p>Here, over his grave, began the passionate discussion which
has never ended, about the merits of Nekrásoff as a poet.
While speaking over his grave, Dostoyévskiy put Nekrásoff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
by the side of Púshkin and Lérmontoff (“higher still than
Púshkin and Lérmontoff,” exclaimed some young enthusiast
in the crowd), and the question, “Is Nekrásoff a great
poet, like Púshkin and Lérmontoff?” has been discussed ever
since.</p>

<p>Nekrásoff’s poetry played such an important part in my
own development, during my youth, that I did not dare trust
my own high appreciation of it; and therefore to verify and
support my impressions and appreciations I have compared
them with those of the Russian critics, Arsénieff, Skabitchévskiy,
and Venguéroff (the author of a great biographical
dictionary of Russian authors).</p>

<p>When we enter the period of adolescence, from sixteen
years to twenty, we need to find words to express the
aspirations and the higher ideas which begin to wake up in
our minds. It is not enough to have these aspirations: we
want <i>words</i> to express them. Some will find these words in
those of the prayers which they hear in the church; others—and
I belonged to their number—will not be satisfied with
this expression of their feelings: it will strike them as too
vague, and they will look for something else to express in
more concrete terms their growing sympathies with mankind
and the philosophical questions about the life of the universe
which pre-occupy them. They will look for poetry. For me,
Goethe on the one side, by his philosophical poetry, and
Nekrásoff on the other, by the concrete images in which he
expressed his love of the peasant masses, supplied the words
which the heart wanted for the expression of its poetical feelings.
But this is only a personal remark. The question is,
whether Nekrásoff can really be put by the side of Púshkin
and Lérmontoff as a great poet.</p>

<p>Some people repudiate such a comparison. He was not a
poet, they say, because he always wrote with a purpose. However,
this reasoning, which is often defended by the pure
æsthetics, is evidently incorrect. Shelley also had a purpose,
which did not prevent him from being a great poet; Browning
has a purpose in a number of his poems, and this did not
prevent him from being a great poet. Every great poet has a
purpose in most of his poems, and the question is only whether
he has found a beautiful form for expressing this purpose, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
not. The poet who shall succeed in combining a really beautiful
form, <i>i. e.</i>, impressive images and sonorous verses, with a
grand purpose, will be the greatest poet.</p>

<p>Now, one certainly feels, on reading Nekrásoff, that he
had difficulty in writing his verses. There is nothing in his
poetry similar to the easiness with which Púshkin used the
forms of versification for expressing his thoughts, nor is there
any approach to the musical harmony of Lérmontoff’s verse
or A. K. Tolstóy’s. Even in his best poems there are lines
which are not agreeable to the ear on account of their wooden
and clumsy form; but you feel that these unhappy verses
could be improved by the change of a few words, without the
beauty of the images in which the feelings are expressed
being altered by that. One certainly feels that Nekrásoff was
not master enough of his words and his rhymes; but there is
not one single poetical image which does not suit the whole
idea of the poem, or which strikes the reader as a dissonance,
or is not beautiful; while in some of his verses Nekrásoff has
certainly succeeded in combining a very high degree of poetical
inspiration with great beauty of form. It must not be
forgotten that the <i>Yambs</i> of Barbier, and the <i>Châtiments</i> of
Victor Hugo also leave, here and there, much to be desired
as regards form.</p>

<p>Nekrásoff was a most unequal writer, but one of the above-named
critics has pointed out that even amidst his most
unpoetical “poem”—the one in which he describes in very
poor verses the printing office of a newspaper—the moment
that he touches upon the sufferings of the workingman there
come in twelve lines which for the beauty of poetical images
and musicalness, connected with their inner force, have few
equals in the whole of Russian literature.</p>

<p>When we estimate a poet, there is something general in his
poetry which we either love or pass by indifferently, and to
reduce literary criticism exclusively to the analysis of the
beauty of the poet’s verses or to the correspondence between
“idea and form” is surely to immensely reduce its value.
Everyone will recognise that Tennyson possessed a wonderful
beauty of form, and yet he cannot be considered as superior
to Shelley, for the simple reason that the general tenor of
the latter’s ideas was so much superior to the general tenor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of Tennyson’s. It is on the general contents of his poetry
that Nekrásoff’s superiority rests.</p>

<p>We have had in Russia several poets who also wrote upon
social subjects or the duties of a citizen—I need only mention
Pleschéeff and Mináyeff—and they attained sometimes, from
the versifier’s point of view, a higher beauty of form than
Nekrásoff. But in whatever Nekrásoff wrote there is an inner
force which you do not find in either of these poets, and this
force suggests to him images which are rightly considered as
pearls of Russian poetry.</p>

<p>Nekrásoff called his Muse, “A Muse of Vengeance and of
Sadness,” and this Muse, indeed, never entered into compromise
with injustice. Nekrásoff is a pessimist, but his
pessimism, as Venguéroff remarks, has an original character.
Although his poetry contains so many depressing pictures representing
the misery of the Russian masses, nevertheless the
fundamental impression which it leaves upon the reader is an
elevating feeling. The poet does not bow his head before
the sad reality: he enters into a struggle with it, and he is
sure of victory. The reading of Nekrásoff wakes up that discontent
which bears in itself the seeds of recovery.</p>

<p>The mass of the Russian people, the peasants and their
sufferings, are the main themes of our poet’s verses. His love
to the people passes as a red thread through all his works;
he remained true to it all his life. In his younger years that
love saved him from squandering his talent in the sort of life
which so many of his contemporaries have led; later on it
inspired him in his struggle against serfdom; and when serfdom
was abolished he did not consider his work terminated,
as so many of his friends did: he became the poet of the dark
masses oppressed by the economical and political yoke; and
towards the end of his life he did not say: “Well, I have
done what I could,” but till his last breath his verses were a
complaint about not having been enough of a fighter. He
wrote: “Struggle stood in the way of my becoming a poet,
and songs prevented me from becoming a fighter,” and again:
“Only he who is serviceable to the aims of his time, and gives
all his life to the struggle for his brother men—only he will
live longer than his life.”</p>

<p>Sometimes he sounds a note of despair; however, such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
note is not frequent in Nekrásoff. His Russian peasant is not
a man who only sheds tears. He is serene, sometimes humourous,
and sometimes an extremely gay worker. Very seldom
does Nekrásoff idealise the peasant: for the most part he
takes him just as he is, from life itself; and the poet’s faith in
the forces of that Russian peasant is deep and vigorous. “A
little more freedom to breathe—he says—and Russia will
shew that she has men, and that she has a future.” This is an
idea which frequently recurs in his poetry.</p>

<p>The best poem of Nekrásoff is <i>Red-nosed Frost</i>. It is the
apotheosis of the Russian peasant woman. The poem has
nothing sentimental in it. It is written, on the contrary, in a
sort of elevated epic style, and the second part, where Frost
personified passes on his way through the wood, and where
the peasant woman is slowly freezing to death, while bright
pictures of past happiness pass through her brain—all this
is admirable, even from the point of view of the most
æsthetic critics, because it is written in good verses and in a
succession of beautiful images and pictures.</p>

<p><i>The Peasant Children</i> is a charming village idyll. The
“Muse of Vengeance and Sadness”—one of our critics
remarks—becomes wonderfully mild and gentle as soon as
she begins to speak of women and children. In fact, none of
the Russian poets has ever done so much for the apotheosis
of women, and especially of the mother-woman, as this supposedly
severe poet of Vengeance and Sadness. As soon as
Nekrásoff begins to speak of a mother he grows powerful;
and the strophes he devoted to his own mother—a woman
lost in a squire’s house, amidst men thinking only of hunting,
drinking, and exercising their powers as slave owners in their
full brutality—these strophes are real pearls in the poetry of
all nations.</p>

<p>His poem devoted to the exiles in Siberia and to the Russian
women—that is, to the wives of the Decembrists—in
exile, is excellent and contains really beautiful passages, but it
is inferior to either his poems dealing with the peasants or to
his pretty poem, <i>Sasha</i>, in which he describes, contemporaneously
with Turguéneff, the very same types as Rúdin and
Natásha.</p>

<p>It is quite true that Nekrásoff’s verses often bear traces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
a painful struggle with rhyme, and that there are lines in
his poems which are decidedly inferior; but he is certainly
one of our most popular poets amidst the masses of the people.
Part of his poetry has already become the inheritance of all
the Russian nation. He is immensely read—not only by the
educated classes, but by the poorest peasants as well. In fact,
as has been remarked by one of our critics, to understand
Púshkin a certain more or less artificial literary development
is required; while to understand Nekrásoff it is sufficient
for the peasant simply to know reading; and it is difficult
to imagine, without having seen it, the delight with which
Russian children in the poorest village schools are now reading
Nekrásoff and learning full pages from his verses by
heart.</p>

<h3>OTHER PROSE WRITERS OF THE SAME EPOCH</h3>

<p>Having analysed the work of those writers who may be
considered as the true founders of modern Russian literature,
I ought now to review a number of prose-writers and poets
of less renown, belonging to the same epoch. However, following
the plan of this book, only a few words will be said,
and only some of the most remarkable among them will be
mentioned.</p>

<p>A writer of great power, quite unknown in Western
Europe, who occupies a quite unique position in Russian
literature, is <span class="smcap">Serghéi Timoféevitch Aksákovv</span> (1791-1859),
the father of the two Slavophile writers, Konstantín
and Iván Aksákoff. He is in reality a contemporary of Púshkin
and Lérmontoff, but during the first part of his career
he displayed no originality whatever, and lingered in the
fields of pseudo-classicism. It was only after Gógol had
written—that is, after 1846—that he struck a quite new vein,
and attained the full development of his by no means ordinary
talent. In the years 1847-1855 he published his <i>Memoirs
of Angling</i>, <i>Memoirs of a Hunter with his Fowling Piece in
the Government of Orenbúrg</i>, and <i>Stories and Remembrances
of a Sportsman</i>; and these three works would have been sufficient
to conquer for him the reputation of a first-rate writer.
The Orenbúrg region, in the Southern Uráls, was very thinly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
inhabited at that time, and its nature and physiognomy are so
well described in these books that Aksákoff’s work reminds
one of the <i>Natural History of Selbourne</i>. It has the same
accuracy; but Aksákoff is moreover a poet and a first-rate
poetical landscape painter. Besides, he so admirably knew the
life of the animals, and he so well <i>understood</i> them, that
in this respect his rivals could only be Krylóff on the one
hand, and Brehm the elder and Audubon among the naturalists.</p>

<p>The influence of Gógol induced S. T. Aksákoff to entirely
abandon the domain of pseudo-classical fiction. In 1846
he began to describe real life, and the result was a large
work, <i>A Family Chronicle and Remembrances</i> (1856), soon
followed by <i>The Early Years of Bagróff-the-Grandchild</i>
(1858), which put him in the first ranks among the writers
of his century. Slavophile enthusiasts described him even
as a Shakespeare, nay, as a Homer; but all exaggeration
apart, S. T. Aksákoff has really succeeded not only in
reproducing a whole epoch in his <i>Memoirs</i>, but also in
creating real types of men of that time, which have served
as models for all our subsequent writers. If the leading
idea of these <i>Memoirs</i> had not been so much in favour
of the “good old times” of serfdom, they would have
been even much more widely read than they are now.
The appearance of <i>A Family Chronicle</i>—in 1856—was
an event, and the marking of an epoch in Russian
literature.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">V. Dal</span> (1801-1872) cannot be omitted even from this
short sketch. He was born in Southeastern Russia, of a
Danish father and a Franco-German mother, and received
his education at the Dorpat university. He was a naturalist
and a doctor by profession, but his favourite study was
ethnography, and he became a remarkable ethnographer, as
well as one of the best connoisseurs of the Russian spoken
language and its provincial dialects. His sketches from the
life of the people, signed <span class="smcap">Kozak Luganskiy</span> (about a hundred
of them are embodied in a volume, <i>Pictures from
Russian Life</i>, 1861), were very widely read in the forties
and the fifties, and were highly praised by Turguéneff and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Byelínskiy. Although they are mere sketches and leaflets
from a diary, without real poetical creation, they are delightful
reading. As to the ethnographical work of Dal it was
colossal. During his continual peregrinations over Russia, in
his capacity of a military doctor attached to his regiment, he
made most wonderful collections of words, expressions,
riddles, proverbs, and so on, and embodied them in two large
works. His main work is <i>An Explanatory Dictionary of the
Russian Language</i>, in four quarto volumes (first edition in
1861-68, second in 1880-1882). This is really a monumental
work and contains the first and very successful attempt at
a lexicology of the Russian language, which, notwithstanding
some occasional mistakes, is of the greatest value for the
understanding and the etymology of the Russian tongue as
it is spoken in different provinces. It contains at the same
time a precious and extremely rich collection of linguistic
material for future research, part of which would have been
lost by now if Dal had not collected it, fifty years ago, before
the advent of railways. Another great work of Dal, only
second to the one just mentioned, is a collection of proverbs,
entitled <i>The Proverbs of the Russian People</i> (second edition
in 1879).</p>

<p>A writer who occupies a prominent place in the evolution
of the Russian novel, but has not yet been sufficiently appreciated,
is <span class="smcap">Ivan Panáeff</span> (1812-1862), who was a great
friend of all the literary circle of the <i>Sovreménnik</i> (<i>Contemporary</i>).
Of this review he was co-editor with Nekrásoff,
and he wrote for it a mass of literary notes and <i>feuilletons</i>
upon all sorts of subjects, extremely interesting for characterising
those times. In his novels Panáeff, like Turguéneff,
took his types chiefly from the educated classes, both at St.
Petersburg and in the provinces. His collection of “Swaggerers”
(<i>hlyschí</i>), both from the highest classes in the
capitals, and from provincials, is not inferior to Thackeray’s
collection of “snobs.” In fact, the “swaggerer,” as Panáeff
understood him, is even a much broader and much more complicated
type of man than the snob, and cannot easily be
described in a few words. The greatest service rendered by
Panáeff was, however, the creation in his novels of a series
of such exquisite types of Russian women that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
truly described by some critics as “the spiritual mothers of
the heroines of Turguéneff.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Herzen</span> (1812-1870) also belongs to the same epoch,
but he will be spoke of in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>A very sympathetic woman writer, who belongs to the
same group and deserves in reality much more than a brief
notice, is <span class="smcap">N. D. Hvoschinskaya</span> (1825-1869; Zaionchkóvskaya
after her marriage). She wrote under the masculine
<i>nom-de-plume</i> of <span class="smcap">V. Krestovskiy</span>, and in order not to
confound her with a very prolific writer of novels in the
style of the French detective novel—the author of <i>St. Petersburg
Slums</i>, whose name was <span class="smcap">Vsevolod Krestovskiy</span>—she
is usually known in Russia as “V. Krestóvskiy-pseudonyme.”</p>

<p>N. D. Hvóschinskaya began to write very early, in 1847,
and her novels were endowed with such an inner charm that
they were always admired by the general public and were
widely read. It must, however, be said that during the first
part of her literary career the full value of her work was
not appreciated, and that down to the end of the seventies
literary criticism remained hostile to her. It was only towards
the end of her career (in 1878-1880) that our best literary
critics—Mihailóvskiy, Arsénieff and the novelist Boborýkin—recognised
the full value of this writer, who certainly
deserves being placed by the side of George Eliot and the
author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>.</p>

<p>N. D. Hvóschinskaya certainly was not one of those who
conquer their reputation at once; but the cause of the rather
hostile attitude of Russian critics towards her was that,
having been born in a poor nobleman’s family of Ryazán,
and having spent all her life in the province, her novels of
the first period, in which she dealt with provincial life and
provincial types only, suffered from a certain narrowness of
view. This last defect was especially evident in those types
of men for whom the young author tried to win sympathy,
but who, after all, had no claims to it, and simply proved
that the author felt the need of idealising somebody, at least,
in her sad surroundings.</p>

<p>Apart from this defect, N. D. Hvóschinskaya knew provincial
life very well and pictured it admirably. She represented
it exactly in the same pessimistic light in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Turguéneff saw it in those same years—the last years of
the reign of Nicholas I. She excelled especially in representing
the sad and hopeless existence of the girl in most of the
families of those times.</p>

<p>In her own family she meets the bigoted tyranny of her
mother and the “let-me-alone” egotism of her father, and
among her admirers she finds only a collection of good-for-nothings
who cover their shallowness with empty, sonorous
phrases. Every novel written by our author during this
period contains the drama of a girl whose best self is crushed
back in such surroundings, or it relates the still more heart-rending
drama of an old maid compelled to live under the
tyranny, the petty persecutions and the pin-prickings of her
relations.</p>

<p>When Russia entered into a better period, in the early
sixties, the novels of N. D. Hvóschinskaya also took a
different, much more hopeful character, and among them
<i>The Great Bear</i> (1870-71) is the most prominent. At the
time of its appearance it produced quite a sensation amidst
our youth, and it had upon them a deeper influence, in the
very best sense of the word, than any other novel. The
heroine, Kátya, meets, in Verhóvskiy, a man of the weakling
type which we know from Turguéneff’s <i>Correspondence</i>, but
dressed this time in the garb of a social reformer, prevented
only by “circumstances” and “misfortunes” from accomplishing
greater things. Verhóvskiy, whom Kátya loves and
who falls in love with her—so far, at least, as such men can
fall in love—is admirably pictured. It is one of the best
representatives in the already rich gallery of such types in
Russian literature. It must be owned that there are in <i>The
Great Bear</i> one or two characters which are not quite real,
or, at least, are not correctly appreciated by the author (for
instance, the old Bagryánskiy); but we find also a fine collection
of admirably painted characters; while Kátya stands
higher, is more alive, and is more fully pictured, than Turguéneff’s
Natásha or even his Helen. She has had enough
of all the talk about heroic deeds which “circumstances”
prevent the would-be heroes from accomplishing, and she
takes to a much smaller task: she becomes a loving school
mistress in a village school, and undertakes to bring into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
village-darkness her higher ideals and her hopes of a better
future. The appearance of this novel, just at the time when
that great movement of the youth “towards the people”
was beginning in Russia, made it favourite reading by the
side of <span class="smcap">Mordóvtseff’s</span> <i>Signs of the Times</i>, and Spielhagen’s
<i>Amboss und Hammer</i> and <i>In Reih und Glied</i>. The warm
tone of the novel and the refined, deeply humane, poetical
touches of which it is full—all these added immensely to
the inner merits of <i>The Great Bear</i>. In Russia it has sown
many a good idea, and there is no doubt that if it were known
in Western Europe, it would be, here as well, a favourite
with the thinking and well inspired young women and men.</p>

<p>A third period may be distinguished in the art of N.
Hvóschinskaya, after the end of the seventies. The novels
of this period—among which the series entitled <i>The Album:
Groups and Portraits</i> is the most striking—have a new character.
When the great liberal movement which Russia had
lived through in the early sixties came to an end, and
reaction had got the upper hand, after 1864, hundreds and
hundreds of those who had been prominent in this movement
as representatives of advanced thought and reform abandoned
the faith and the ideals of their best years. Under a
thousand various pretexts they now tried to persuade themselves—and,
of course, those women who had trusted them—that
new times had come, and new requirements had grown
up; that they had only become “practical” when they
deserted the old banner and ranged themselves under a new
one—that of personal enrichment; that to do this was on
their part a necessary self-sacrifice, a manifestation of “virile
citizenship,” which requires from every man that he should
not stop even before the sacrifice of his ideals in the interest
of his “cause.” “V. Krestovskiy,” as a woman who had
loved the ideals, understood better than any man the real
sense of these sophisms. She must have bitterly suffered from
them in her personal life; and I doubt whether in any literature
there is a collection of such “groups and portraits” of
deserters as we see in <i>The Album</i>, and especially in <i>At the
Photographer’s</i>. In reading these stories we are conscious of
a loving heart which bleeds as it describes these deserters,
and this makes of “The groups and portraits” of N. D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Hvóschinskaya one of the finest pieces of “subjective
realism” we possess in our literature.</p>

<p>Two sisters of N. D. Hvóschinskaya, who wrote under
the <i>noms-de-plume</i> of <span class="smcap">Zimaroff</span> and <span class="smcap">Vesenieff</span>, were also
novelists. The former wrote a biography of her sister
Nathalie.</p>

<h3>POETS OF THE SAME EPOCH</h3>

<p>Several poets of the epoch described in the last two
chapters ought to be analysed at some length in this place,
if this book pretended to be a Course in Russian literature.
I shall have, however, to limit myself to very short notes,
although most of the poets could not have failed to be
favourites with other nations if they had written in a
language better known abroad than Russian.</p>

<p>Such was certainly <span class="smcap">Koltsoff</span> (1808-1842), a poet from
the people, who has sung in his songs, so deeply appealing
to every poetical mind, the borderless steppes of Southern
Russia, the poor life of the tiller of the soil, the sad existence
of the Russian peasant woman, that love which is for the
loving soul only a source of acute suffering, that fate which
is not a mother but a step-mother, and that happiness which
has been so short and has left behind only tears and sadness.</p>

<p>The style, the contents, the form—all was original in this
poet of the Steppes. Even the form of his verse is not the
form established in Russian prosody: it is something as
musical as the Russian folk-song and in places is equally
irregular. However, every line of the poetry of the Koltsóff
of his second period—when he had freed himself from
imitation and had become a true poet of the people—every
expression and every thought appeal to the heart and fill it
with poetical love for nature and men. Like all the best Russian
poets he died very young, just at the age when he was
reaching the full maturity of his talent and deeper questions
were beginning to inspire his poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nikitin</span> (1824-1861) was another poet of a similar type.
He was born in a poor artisan’s family, also in South Russia.
His life in this family, of which the head was continually
under the influence of drink, and which the young man had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
to maintain, was terrible. He also died young, but he left
some very fine and most touching pieces of poetry, in which,
with a simplicity that we shall find only with the later folk-novelists,
he described scenes from popular life, coloured
with the deep sadness impressed upon him by his own
unhappy life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Pleschéeff</span> (1825-1893) has been for the last thirty
years of his life one of the favourite Russian poets. Like so
many other gifted men of his generation, he was arrested
in 1849 in connection with the affair of the “Petrashévskiy
circles,” for which Dostoyévskiy was sent to hard labour. He
was found even less “guilty” than the great novelist, and
was marched as a soldier to the Orenbúrg region, where he
probably would have died a soldier, if Nicholas I. had not
himself died in 1856. He was pardoned by Alexander II.,
and permitted to settle at Moscow.</p>

<p>Unlike so many of his contemporaries, Pleschéeff never let
himself be crushed by persecution, or by the dark years which
Russia has lately lived through. On the contrary, he always
retained that same note of vigour, freshness, and faith in his
humanitarian though perhaps too abstract ideals, which characterised
his first poetical productions in the forties. Only
towards his very latest years, under the influence of ill-health,
did a pessimistic note begin to creep into his verses. Besides
writing original poetry he translated very much, and admirably
well, from the German, English, French and Italian
poets.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Besides these three poets, who sought their inspiration
in the realities of life or in higher humanitarian ideals, we
have a group of poets who are usually described as admirers
of “pure beauty” and “Art for Art’s sake.” <span class="smcap">Th. Tyútcheff</span>
(1803-1873) may be taken as the best, or, at any
rate, the eldest representative of this group. Turguéneff
spoke of him very highly—in 1854—praising his fine and
true feeling for nature and his fine taste. The influence of the
epoch of Púshkin upon him was evident, and he certainly was
endowed with the impressionability and sincerity which are
necessary in a good poet. With all that, his verses are not
much read, and seem rather dull to our generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apollon Maykoff</span> (1821-1897) is often described as
a poet of pure art for art’s sake; at any rate, this is what
he preached in theory; but in reality his poetry belonged to
four distinct domains. In his youth he was a pure admirer
of antique Greece and Rome, and his chief work, <i>Two
Worlds</i>, was devoted to the conflict between antique paganism
and natureism and Christianity—the best types in his poem
being representatives of the former. Later on he wrote
several very good pieces of poetry devoted to the history
of the Church in mediæval times. Still later, in the sixties,
he was carried away by the liberal movement in Russia and
in Western Europe, and his poems were imbued with its spirit
of freedom. He wrote during those years his best poems, and
made numbers of excellent translations from Heine. And
finally, after the liberal period had come to an end in Russia,
he also changed his opinions and began to write in the
opposite direction, losing more and more both the sympathy
of his readers and his talent. Apart from some of the productions
of this last period of decay, the verses of Máykoff
are as a rule very musical, really poetical, and not devoid
of force. In his earlier productions and in some pieces of
his third period, he attained real beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">N. Scherbina</span> (1821-1869), also an admirer of classical
Greece, may be mentioned for his really good anthological
poetry from the life of Greek antiquity, in which he even
excelled Máykoff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polonskiy</span> (1820-1898), a contemporary and a great
friend of Turguéneff, displayed all the elements of a great
artist. His verses are full of true melody, his poetical images
are rich, and yet natural and simple, and the subjects he took
were not devoid of originality. This is why his verses were
always read with interest. But he had none of that force, or
of that depth of conception, or of that intensity of passion
which might have made of him a great poet. His best piece,
<i>A Musical Cricket</i>, is written in a jocose mood, and his most
popular verses are those which he wrote in the style of folk-poetry.
One may say that they have become the property of
the people. Altogether Polonskiy appealed chiefly to the
quiet, moderate “intellectual” who does not much care about
going to the bottom of the great problems of life. If he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
touched upon some of these, it was owing to a passing, rather
than to a life interest in them.</p>

<p>One more poet of this group, perhaps the most characteristic
of it, was <span class="smcap">A. Shenshin</span> (1820-1892), much better
known under his <i>nom-de-plume</i> of <span class="smcap">A. Fet</span>. He remained all
his life a poet of “pure art for art’s sake.” He wrote a
good deal about economical and social matters, always in
the reactionary sense, but—in prose. As to verses, he never
resorted to them for anything but the worship of beauty
for beauty’s sake. In this direction he succeeded very well.
His short verses are especially pretty and sometimes almost
beautiful. Nature, in its quiet, lovely aspects, which lead to
a gentle, aimless sadness, he depicted sometimes to perfection,
as also those moods of the mind which can be best described
as indefinite sensations, slightly erotic. However, taken as a
whole, his poetry appears monotonous.</p>

<p>To the same group one might add <span class="smcap">A. K. Tolstóy</span>, whose
verses attain sometimes a rare perfection and sound like the
best music. The feelings expressed in them may not be very
deep, but the form and the music of the verses are delightful.
They have, moreover, the stamp of originality, because
nobody could write poems in the style of Russian folk-poetry
better than Alexéi Tolstóy. Theoretically, he preached art
for art’s sake. But he never remained true to this canon and,
taking either the life of old epical Russia, or the period of
the struggle between the Moscow Tsars and the feudal
boyars, he developed his admiration of the olden times in
very beautiful verses. He also wrote a novel, <i>Prince Serébryanyi</i>,
from the times of John the Terrible, which was very
widely read; but his main work was a trilogy of dramas from
the same interesting period of Russian history (see Ch. VI).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Almost all the poets just mentioned have translated a great
deal, and they have enriched Russian literature with such a
number of translations from all languages—so admirably
done as a rule—that no other literature of the world, not
even the German, can claim to possess an equally great
treasury. Some translations, beginning with Zhukóvskiy’s
rendering of the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>, or the translations of
<i>Hiawatha</i>, are simply classical. All Schiller, most of Goethe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
nearly all Byron, a great deal of Shelley, all that is worth
knowing in Tennyson, Wordsworth, Crabbe, all that could
be translated from Browning, Barbier, Victor Hugo, and so
on, are as familiar in Russia as in the mother countries of
these poets, and occasionally even more so. As to such
favourites as Heine, I really don’t know whether his best
poems lose anything in those splendid translations which we
owe to our best poets; while the songs of Béranger, in the
free translation of <i>Kúrotchkin</i>, are not in the least inferior to
the originals.</p>

<p>We have moreover some excellent poets who are chiefly
known for their translations. Such are: <span class="smcap">N. Gerbel</span> (1827-1883),
who made his reputation by an admirable rendering
of the <i>Lay of Igor’s Raid</i> (see Ch. I.), and later on, by his
versions of a great number of West European poets. His
edition of <i>Schiller, translated by Russian Poets</i> (1857), followed
by similar editions of Shakespeare, Byron, and Goethe,
was epoch making.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mikhail Mikháiloff</span> (1826-1865), one of the most
brilliant writers of the <i>Contemporary</i>, condemned in 1861
to hard labour in Siberia, where he died four years later, was
especially renowned for his translations from Heine, as also
for those from Longfellow, Hood, Tennyson, Lenan, and
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. Weinberg</span> (born 1830) made his reputation by his
excellent translations from Shakespeare, Byron (<i>Sardanapal</i>),
Shelley (<i>Cenci</i>), Sheridan, Coppe, Gutzkow, Heine,
etc., and for his editions of the work of Goethe and Heine
in Russian translations. He still continues to enrich Russian
literature with excellent versions of the masterpieces of foreign
literatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. Mey</span> (1822-1862), the author of a number of poems
from popular life, written in a very picturesque language, and
of several dramas, of which those from old Russian life are
especially valuable and were taken by <span class="smcap">Rímsky Korsákoff</span>
as the subjects of his operas, has also made a great number of
translations. He translated not only from the modern West
European poets—English, French, German, Italian, and
Polish—but also from Greek, Latin, and Old Hebrew, all
of which languages he knew to perfection. Besides excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
translations of Anacreon and the idylls of Theocritus, he
wrote also beautiful poetical versions of the <i>Song of Songs</i>
and of various other portions of the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. Mináyeff</span> (1835-1889), the author of a great number
of satirical verses, also belongs to this group of translators.
His renderings from Byron, Burns, Cornwall, and
Moore, Goethe and Heine, Leopardi, Dante, and several
others, were, as a rule, extremely fine.</p>

<p>And finally I must mention one, at least, of the prose-translators,
<span class="smcap">Vvedénskiy</span> (1813-1855), for his very fine
translations of the chief novels of Dickens. His renderings
are real works of art, the result of a perfect knowledge of
English life, and of such a deep assimilation of the genius of
Dickens that the translator almost identified himself with the
original author.</p>

</div>


<p>The Drama in Russia, as everywhere else, had a
double origin. It developed out of the religious
“mysteries” on the one hand and the popular
comedy on the other, witty interludes being introduced
into the grave, moral representations, the subjects of which
were borrowed from the Old or the New Testament.
Several such mysteries were adapted in the seventeenth century
by the teachers of the Graeco-Latin Theological Academy
at Kíeff for representation in Little Russian by the
students of the Academy, and later on these adaptations
found their way to Moscow.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century—on the eve,
so to speak, of the reforms of Peter I.—a strong desire to
introduce Western habits of life was felt in certain small
circles at Moscow, and the father of Peter, the Tsar Alexis,
was not hostile to it. He took a liking to theatrical representations,
and induced some foreigners residing at Moscow to
write pieces for representation at the palace. A certain Gregory
undertook this task and, taking German versions of
plays, which used to be called at that time “English Plays,”
he adapted them to Russian tastes. <i>The Comedy of Queen
Esther and the Haughty Haman</i>, <i>Tobias</i>, <i>Judith</i>, etc., were
represented before the Tsar. A high functionary of the
Church, <span class="smcap">Simeon Pólotskiy</span>, did not disdain to write such
mysteries, and several of them have come down to us; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
a daughter of Alexis, the princess Sophie (a pupil of
Simeon), breaking with the strict habits of isolation which
were then obligatory for women, had theatrical representations
given at the palace in her presence.</p>

<p>This was too much for the old Moscow Conservatives, and
after the death of Alexis the theatre was closed; and so it
remained a quarter of a century, <i>i. e.</i>, until 1702, when Peter
I., who was very fond of the drama, opened a theatre in the
old capital. He had a company of actors brought for the
purpose from Dantsig, and a special house was built for them
within the holy precincts of the Kremlin. More than that,
another sister of Peter I., Nathalie, who was as fond of
dramatic performances as the great reformer himself, a few
years later took all the properties of this theatre to her own
palace, and had the representations given there—first in
German, and later on in Russian. It is also very probable that
she herself wrote a few dramas—perhaps in collaboration
with one of the pupils of a certain Doctor Bidlo, who had
opened another theatre at the Moscow Hospital, the actors
being the students. Later on the theatre of Princess Nathalie
was transferred to the new capital founded by her brother on
the Nevá.</p>

<p>The <i>répertoire</i> of this theatre was pretty varied, and
included, besides German dramas, like <i>Scipio the African</i>,
<i>Don Juan and Don Pedro</i>, and the like, free translations
from Molière, as also German farces of a very rough character.
There were, besides a few original Russian dramas
(partly contributed, apparently, by Nathalie), which were
compositions drawn from the lives of the Saints, and from
some Polish novels, widely read at that time in Russian
manuscript translations.</p>

<p>It was out of these elements and out of West European
models that the Russian drama evolved, when the theatre
became, in the middle of the eighteenth century, a permanent
institution. It is most interesting to note, that it was not in
either of the capitals, but in a provincial town, Yarosláv,
under the patronage of the local tradesmen, that the first
permanent Russian theatre was founded, in 1750, and also
that it was by the private enterprise of a few actors: the two
brothers Vólkoff, Dmitrévsky, and several others. The Empress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Elisabeth—probably following the advice of Sumarókoff,
who himself began about that time to write dramas—ordered
these actors to move to St. Petersburg, where they
became “artists of the Imperial Theatre,” in the service of
the Crown. Thus, the Russian theatre became, in 1756, an
institution of the Government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sumarókoff</span> (1718-1777), who wrote, besides verses
and fables (the latter of real value), a considerable number
of tragedies and comedies, played an important part in the
development of the Russian drama. In his tragedies he imitated
Racine and Voltaire. He followed strictly their rules of
“unity,” and cared even less than they did for historical
truth; but as he had not the great talent of his French
masters, he made of his heroes mere personifications of certain
virtues or vices, figures quite devoid of life, and indulging
in endless pompous monologues. Several of his tragedies
(<i>Hórev</i>, written in 1747, <i>Sináv and Trúvor</i>, <i>Yaropólk and
Dílitza</i>, <i>Dmítri the Impostor</i>) were taken from Russian history;
but after all their heroes were as little Slavonian
as Racine’s heroes were Greek and Roman. This, however,
must be said in favour of Sumarókoff, that he never failed
to express in his tragedies the more advanced humanitarian
ideas of the times—sometimes with real feeling, which
pierced through even the conventional forms of speech of his
heroes. As to his comedies, although they had not the same
success as his serious dramas, they were much nearer to life.
They contained touches of the real life of Russia, especially
of the life of the Moscow nobility, and their satirical character
undoubtedly influenced Sumarókoff’s followers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knyazhnín</span> (1742-1791) followed on the same lines.
Like Sumarókoff he translated tragedies from the French,
and also wrote imitations of French tragedies, taking his subjects
partly from Russian history (<i>Rossláv</i>, 1784; <i>Vadím of
Nóvgorod</i>, which was printed after his death and was
immediately destroyed by the Government on account of its
tendencies towards freedom).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ozeroff</span> (1769-1816) continued the work of Knyazhnín,
but introduced the sentimental and the romantic
elements into his pseudo-classical tragedies (<i>Oedipus in
Athens</i>, <i>Death of Olèg</i>). With all their defects these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
tragedies enjoyed a lasting success, and powerfully contributed
to the development of both the stage and a public of
serious playgoers.</p>

<p>At the same time comedies also began to be written by the
same authors (<i>The Brawler</i>, <i>Strange People</i>, by Knyazhnín)
and their followers, and although they were for the most part
imitations of the French, nevertheless subjects taken from
Russian everyday life began to be introduced. Sumarókoff
had already done something in this direction, and he had been
seconded by <span class="smcap">Catherine II.</span>, who contributed a couple of
satirical comedies, taken from her surroundings, such as <i>The
Fête of Mrs. Grumbler</i>, and a comic opera from Russian
popular life. She was perhaps the first to introduce Russian
peasants on the stage; and it is worthy of note that the taste
for a popular vein on the stage rapidly developed—the
comedies, <i>The Miller</i> by <span class="smcap">Ablesímoff</span>, <i>Zbítenshik</i> (<i>The
Hawker</i>), by Knyazhnín, and so on, all taken from the life
of the people, being for some time great favourites with the
playgoers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Von-Wizin</span> has already been mentioned in a previous
chapter, and it is sufficient here to recall the fact, that by
his two comedies, <i>The Brigadier</i> (1768) and <i>Nédorosl</i>
(1782), which continued to be played up to the middle of
the nineteenth century he became the father of the realistic
satirical comedy in Russia. <i>Denunciation</i> (<i>Yábeda</i>), by <span class="smcap">Kapníst</span>,
and a few comedies contributed by the great fable-writer
<span class="smcap">Krylóff</span> belong to the same category.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST YEARS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>During the first thirty years of the nineteenth century the
Russian theatre developed remarkably. The stage produced,
at St. Petersburg and at Moscow, a number of gifted and
original actors and actresses, both in tragedy and in
comedy. The number of writers for the stage became so
considerable that all the forms of dramatic art were able to
develop at the same time. During the Napoleonic wars
patriotic tragedies, full of allusions to current events, such as
<i>Dmítri Donskói</i> (1807), by Ozeroff, invaded the stage.
However, the pseudo-classical tragedy continued to hold its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
own. Better translations and imitations of Racine were produced
(<span class="smcap">Katénin</span>, <span class="smcap">Kokóshkin</span>) and enjoyed a certain
success, especially at St. Petersburg, owing to good tragic
actors of the declamatory school. At the same time translations
of <span class="smcap">Kotzebue</span> had an enormous success, as also the Russian
productions of his sentimental imitators.</p>

<p>Romanticism and pseudo-classicalism were, of course, at
war with each other for the possession of the stage, as they
were in the domains of poetry and the novel; but, owing to
the spirit of the time, and patronised as it was by <span class="smcap">Karamzín</span>
and <span class="smcap">Zhukóvskiy</span>, romanticism triumphed. It was aided
especially by the energetic efforts of Prince <span class="smcap">Shahovskóy</span>,
who wrote, with a good knowledge of the stage, more than a
hundred varied pieces—tragedies, comedies, operas, vaudevilles
and ballets—taking the subjects for his dramas from
Walter Scott, Ossian, Shakespeare, and Púshkin. At the same
comedy, and especially satirical comedy, as also the vaudeville
(which approached comedy by a rather more careful treatment
of characters than is usual in that sort of literature on
the French stage), were represented by a very great number
of more or less original productions. Besides the excellent
translations of <span class="smcap">Hmelnítzkiy</span> from Molière, the public enjoyed
also the pieces of <span class="smcap">Zagóskin</span>, full of good-hearted
merriment, the sometimes brilliant and always animated
comedies and vaudevilles of Shahovskóy, the vaudevilles of
<span class="smcap">A. I. Písareff</span>, and so on. True, all the comedies were either
directly inspired by Molière or were adaptations from the
French into which Russian characters and Russian manners
had been introduced. But as there was still some original
creation in these adaptions, which was carried a step
further on the stage by gifted actors of the natural, realist
school, it all prepared the way for the truly Russian comedy,
which found its embodiment in Griboyédoff, Gógol and
Ostróvskiy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<h3>GRIBOYÉDOFF.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Griboyédoff</span> (1795-1829) died very young, and all that
he left was one comedy, <i>Misfortune from Intelligence</i> (<i>Góre
ot Umá</i>), and a couple of scenes from an unfinished tragedy
in the Shakespearean style. However, the comedy is a work
of genius, and owing to it alone, Griboyédoff may be described
as having done for the Russian stage what Púshkin
has done for Russian poetry.</p>

<p>Griboyédoff was born at Moscow, and received a good
education at home before he entered the Moscow University,
at the age of fifteen. Here he was fortunate enough to fall
under the influence of the historian Schlötzer and Professor
Buhle, who developed in him the desire for a thorough acquaintance
with the world-literature, together with habits of
serious work. It was consequently during his stay at the
University (1810-1812) that Griboyédoff wrote the first
sketch of his comedy, at which he worked for the next twelve
years.</p>

<p>In 1812, during the invasion of Napoleon, he entered the
military service, and for four years remained an officer of the
hussars, chiefly in Western Russia. The spirit of the army was
quite different then from what it became later on, under
Nicholas I.: it was in the army that the “Decembrists” made
their chief propaganda, and Griboyédoff met among his
comrades men of high humanitarian tendencies. In 1816 he
left the military service, and, obeying the desire of his
mother, entered the diplomatic service at St. Petersburg,
where he became friendly with the “Decembrists” Tchaadáeff
(see Ch. VIII.), Ryléeff, and Odóevskiy (see Ch.
I. and II.).</p>

<p>A duel, in which Griboyédoff took part as a second, was
the cause of the future dramatist’s removal from St. Petersburg.
His mother insisted upon his being sent as far as possible
from the capital, and he was accordingly despatched to
Teheran. He travelled a good deal in Persia, and, with his
wonderful activity and liveliness, took a prominent part in the
diplomatic work of the Russian Embassy. Later on, staying at
Tiflís, and acting as a secretary to the Lieutenant of the
Caucasus, he worked hard in the same diplomatic domain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
but he worked also all the time at his comedy, and in 1824 he
finished it, while he was for a few months in Central Russia.
Owing to a mere accident the manuscript of <i>Misfortune from
Intelligence</i> became known to a few friends, and the comedy
produced a tremendous sensation among them. In a few
months it was being widely read in manuscript copies, raising
storms of indignation amongst the old generation, and provoking
the greatest admiration among the young. All efforts,
however, to obtain its production on the stage, or even to have
it represented once in private, were thwarted by censorship,
and Griboyédoff returned to the Caucasus without having
seen his comedy played at a theatre.</p>

<p>There, at Tiflís, he was arrested a few days after the 14th
of December, 1825 (see Ch. I.), and taken in all speed to the
St. Petersburg fortress, where his best friends were already
imprisoned. It is said in the Memoirs of one of the Decembrists
that even in the gloomy surroundings of the fortress
the habitual brightness of Griboyédoff did not leave him. He
used to tell his unfortunate friends such amusing stories by
means of taps on the walls that they rolled on their beds,
laughing like children.</p>

<p>In June, 1826, he was set free, and sent back to Tiflís. But
after the execution of some of his friends—Ryléeff was
among them—and the harsh sentence to hard labour for life
in Siberian mines, which was passed upon all the others, his
old gaiety was gone forever.</p>

<p>At Tiflís he worked harder than ever at spreading seeds
of a better civilisation in the newly conquered territory; but
next year he had to take part in the war of 1827-1828 against
Persia, accompanying the army as a diplomatic agent, and
after a crushing defeat of the Shah, Abbas-mirza, it was he
who concluded the well-known Turkmanchái treaty, by which
Russia obtained rich provinces from Persia and gained such
an influence over her inner affairs. After a flying visit to St.
Petersburg, Griboyédoff was sent once more to Teheran—this
time as an ambassador. Before leaving, he married at
Tiflís a Georgian princess of remarkable beauty, but he felt,
as he left the Caucasus for Persia, that his chances of returning
alive were few: “Abbas Miraz,” he wrote, “will never
pardon me the Turkmanchái treaty”—and so it happened. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
few months after his arrival at Teheran a crowd of Persians
fell upon the Russian embassy, and Griboyédoff was killed.</p>

<p>For the last few years of his life, Griboyédoff had not
much time nor taste for literary work. He knew that nothing
he desired to write could ever see the light. Even <i>Misfortune
from Intelligence</i> had been so mutilated by censorship that
many of its best passages had lost all sense. He wrote, however,
a tragedy in the romantic style, <i>A Georgian Night</i>, and
those of his friends who had read it in full rated extremely
high its poetic and dramatic qualities; but only two scenes
from this tragedy and the outline of its contents have reached
us. The manuscript was lost—perhaps at Teheran.</p>

<p><i>Misfortune from Intelligence</i> is a most powerful satire,
directed against the high society of Moscow in the years
1820-1830. Griboyédoff knew this society from the inside,
and his types are not invented. Real men gave him the
foundations for such immortal types as Fámusoff, the aged
nobleman, and Skalozúb, the fanatic of militarism, as well as
for all the secondary personages. As to the language in which
Griboyédoff’s personages speak, it has often been remarked
that up to his time only three writers had been such great
masters of the truly Russian spoken language: Púshkin, Krylóff,
and Griboyédoff. Later on, Ostróvskiy could be added to
these three. It is the true language of Moscow. Besides, the
comedy is full of verses so strikingly satirical and so well said,
that scores of them became proverbs known all over Russia.</p>

<p>The idea of the comedy must have been suggested by
Molière’s <i>Misanthrope</i>, and the hero, Tchátskiy, has certainly
much in common with Alceste. But Tchátskiy is, at the
same time, so much Griboyédoff himself, and his cutting
sarcasms are so much the sarcasms which Griboyédoff must
have launched against his Moscow acquaintances, while all
the other persons of the comedy are so truly Moscow people—so
exclusively Moscow nobles—that apart from its leading
motive, the comedy is entirely original and most thoroughly
Russian.</p>

<p>Tchátskiy is a young man who returns from a long journey
abroad, and hastens to the house of an old gentleman,
Fámusoff, whose daughter, Sophie, was his playmate in childhood,
and is loved by him now. However, the object of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
vows has meanwhile made the acquaintance of her father’s
secretary—a most insignificant and repulsive young man,
Moltchálin, whose rules of life are: First, “moderation and
punctuality,” and next, to please everyone in the house of his
superiors, down to the gatekeeper and his dog, “that even
the dog may be kind to me.” Following his rules, Moltchálin
courts at the same time the daughter of his principal and her
maid: the former, to make himself agreeable in his master’s
house, and the latter, because she pleases him. Tchátskiy is
received in a very cold way. Sophie is afraid of his intelligence
and his sarcasm, and her father has already found a partner
for her in Colonel Skalozúb—a military man full six feet
high in his socks, who speaks in a deep bass voice, exclusively
about military matters, but has a fortune and will soon be
a general.</p>

<p>Tchátskiy behaves just as an enamoured young man would
do. He sees nothing but Sophie, whom he pursues with his
adoration, making in her presence stinging remarks about
Moltchálin, and bringing her father to despair by his free
criticism of Moscow manners—the cruelty of the old serf-owners,
the platitudes of the old courtiers, and so on; and as
a climax, at a ball, which Fámusoff gives that night, he indulges
in long monologues against the adoration of the Moscow
ladies for everything French. Sophie, in the meantime,
offended by his remarks about Moltchálin, retaliates by setting
afloat the rumour that Tchátskiy is not quite right in his
mind, a rumour which is taken up with delight by Society at
the ball, and spreads like wildfire.</p>

<p>It has often been said in Russia that the satirical remarks
of Tchátskiy at the ball, being directed against such a trifling
matter as the adoration of foreigners, are rather superficial
and irrelevant. But it is more than probable that Griboyédoff
limited himself to such innocent remarks because he knew
that no others would be tolerated by the censorship; he must
have hoped that these, at least, would not be wiped out by the
censor’s red ink. From what Tchátskiy says during his morning
call in Fámusoff’s study, and from what is dropped by
other personages, it is evident that Griboyédoff had far more
serious criticisms to put into his hero’s mouth.</p>

<p>Altogether, a Russian satirical writer is necessarily placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
under a serious disadvantage with foreigners. When Molière
gives a satirical description of Parisian society this satire is
not strange to the readers of other nations: we all know
something about life in Paris; but when Griboyédoff describes
Moscow society in the same satirical vein, and reproduces in
such an admirable way purely Moscow types—not even
typical Russians, but Moscow types (“On all the Moscow
people,” he says, “there is a special stamp”)—they are so
strange to the Western mind that the translator ought to
be half-Russian himself, and a poet, in order to render
Griboyédoff’s comedy in another language. If such a translation
were made, I am sure that this comedy would become
a favourite on the stages of Western Europe. In Russia it
has been played over and over again up to the present time,
and although it is now seventy years old, it has lost nothing of
its interest and attractiveness.</p>

<h3>THE MOSCOW STAGE.</h3>

<p>In the forties of the nineteenth century the theatre was
treated everywhere with great respect—and more than anywhere
else was this the case in Russia. Italian opera had not
yet reached the development it attained at St. Petersburg
some twenty years later, and Russian opera, represented by
poor singers, and treated as a step-daughter by the directors
of the Imperial Theatres, offered but little attraction. It was
the drama and occasionally the ballet, when some star like
Fanny Elsler appeared on the horizon, which brought together
the best elements of educated society and aroused the
youth of all classes, including the university students. The
dramatic stage was looked upon—to speak in the style of
those years—as “a temple of Art,” a centre of far-reaching
educational influence. As to the actors and actresses, they
endeavoured, in their turn, not merely to render on the stage
the characters created by the dramatist; they did their best to
contribute themselves, like Cruickshank in his illustrations
of Dickens’s novels, to the final creation of the character, by
finding its true personification.</p>

<p>Especially at Moscow did this intellectual intercourse between
the stage and society go on, and a superior conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
of dramatic art was there developed. The intercourse which
Gógol established with the actors who played his <i>Inspector-General</i>,
and especially with <span class="smcap">Schépkin</span>; the influence of the
literary and philosophical circles which had then their seat at
Moscow; and the intelligent appreciation and criticism of
their work which the actors found in the Press—all this concurred
in making of the Moscow Mályi Teátr (Small
Theatre) the cradle of a superior dramatic art. While St.
Petersburg patronised the so-called “French” school of acting—declamatory
and unnaturally refined—the Moscow
stage attained a high degree of perfection in the development
of the naturalistic school. I mean the school of which
Duse is now such a great representative, and to which Lena
Ashwell owed her great success in <i>Resurrection</i>; that is, the
school in which the actor parts with the routine of conventional
stage tradition, and provokes the deepest emotions in
his audience by the depth of his own real feeling and by the
natural truth and simplicity of its expression—the school
which occupies the same position on the stage that the realism
of Turguéneff and Tolstóy occupies in literature.</p>

<p>In the forties and the early fifties this school had attained
its highest perfection at Moscow, and had in its ranks such
first-class actors and actresses as Schépkin—the real soul of
this stage—<span class="smcap">Motcháloff</span>, <span class="smcap">Sadóskiy</span>, <span class="smcap">S. Vasílieff</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Mme. Nikúlina-Kossítskaya</span>, supported by quite a pleiad
of good secondary aids. Their <i>répertoire</i> was not very rich;
but the two comedies of Gógol (<i>Inspector-General</i> and <i>Marriage</i>),
occasionally Griboyédoff’s great satire; a comedy,
<i>The Marriage of Kretchínsky</i>, by <span class="smcap">Sukhovó-Kobýlin</span>, which
gave excellent opportunities for displaying the best qualities
of the artists just named; now and then a drama of Shakespeare,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
plenty of melodramas adapted from the French, and
vaudevilles which came nearer to light comedy than to farce—this
was the ever varied programme of the Small Theatre.
Some plays were played to perfection—combining the
<i>ensemble</i> and the “go” which characterise the Odéon with
the simplicity and naturalness already mentioned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>
<p>The mutual influence which the stage and dramatic authors
necessarily exercise upon each other was admirably illustrated
at Moscow. Several dramatists wrote specially for this
stage—not in order that this or that actress might eclipse all
others, as happens nowadays in those theatres where one play
is played scores of nights in succession, but for this given <i>stage</i>
and its actors as a whole. <span class="smcap">Ostróvskiy</span> (1823-1886) was the
one who best realised this mutual relation between the
dramatic author and the stage, and thus he came to hold with
regard to the Russian drama the same position that Turguéneff
and Tolstóy hold with regard to the Russian novel.</p>

<h3>OSTRÓVSKIY: “POVERTY—NO VICE”</h3>

<p>Ostróvskiy was born at Moscow in the family of a poor
clergyman, and, like the best of the younger generation of his
time, he was from the age of seventeen an enthusiastic visitor
of the Moscow theatre. At that age, we are told, his favourite
talk with his comrades was the stage. He went to the University,
but two years later he was compelled to leave, in consequence
of a quarrel with a professor, and he became an under
clerk in one of the old Commercial tribunals. There he had
the very best opportunities for making acquaintance with the
world of Moscow merchants—a quite separate class which
remained in its isolation the keeper of the traditions of old
Russia. It was from this class that Ostróvskiy took nearly all
the types of his first and best dramas. Only later on did he
begin to widen the circle of his observations, taking in various
classes of educated society.</p>

<p>His first comedy, <i>Pictures of Family Happiness</i>, was written
in 1847, and three years later appeared his first drama, <i>We
shall settle it among Ourselves</i>, or <i>The Bankrupt</i>, which at
once gave him the reputation of a great dramatic writer. It
was printed in a review, and had a great vogue all over Russia
(the actor Sadóvskiy read it widely in private houses at
Moscow), but it was not allowed to be put on the stage.
The Moscow merchants even lodged a complaint with
Nicholas I. against the author, and Ostróvskiy was dismissed
from the civil service and placed under police supervision
as a suspect. Only many years later, four years after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Alexander II. had succeeded his father—that is, in 1860—was
the drama played at Moscow, and even then the
censorship insisted upon introducing at the end of it a
police officer to represent the triumph of justice over the
wickedness of the bankrupt.</p>

<p>For the next five years Ostróvskiy published nothing, but
then he brought out in close succession (1853 and 1854) two
dramas of remarkable power—<i>Don’t take a seat in other
People’s Sledges</i>, and <i>Poverty—No Vice</i>. The subject
of the former was not new: a girl from a tradesman’s
family runs away with a nobleman, who abandons and ill-treats
her when he realises that she will get from her father
neither pardon nor money. But this subject was treated with
such freshness, and the characters were depicted in positions
so well-chosen, that for its literary and stage-qualities the
drama is one of the best Ostróvskiy has written. As to
<i>Poverty—No Vice</i>, it produced a tremendous impression all
over Russia. We see in it a family of the old type, the head of
which is a rich merchant—a man who is wont to impose his
will upon all his surroundings and has no other conception of
life. He has, however, taken outwardly to “civilisation”—that
is, to restaurant-civilisation: he dresses in the fashions of
Western Europe and tries to follow Western customs in his
house—at least in the presence of the acquaintances he makes
in the fashionable restaurants. Nevertheless, his wife is his
slave, and his household trembles at his voice. He has a
daughter who loves, and is loved by, one of her father’s
clerks, Mítya, a most timid but honest young man, and the
mother would like her daughter to marry this clerk; but the
father has made the acquaintance of a more or less wealthy
aged man—a sort of Armenian money-lender, who dresses
according to the latest fashion, drinks champagne instead of
rye-whiskey, and therefore plays among Moscow merchants
a certain rôle of authority in questions of fashion and rules
of propriety. To this man the girl must be married. She is
saved, however, by the interference of her uncle, Lubím Tortsóff.
Lubím was once rich, like his brother, but he was not
satisfied with the dull Philistine life of his surroundings, and
seeing no way out of it and into a better social atmosphere, he
took to drink—to unmitigated drunkenness, such as was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
seen in olden times at Moscow. His wealthy brother has
helped him to get rid of his fortune, and now, in a ragged
mantle, he goes about the lower class taverns, making of
himself a sort of jester for a chance glass of gin. Penniless,
dressed in his rags, cold and hungry, he comes to the young
clerk’s room, asking permission to stay there over night.</p>

<p>The drama goes on at Christmas time, and this gives
Ostróvskiy the opportunity for introducing all sorts of songs
and Christmas masquerades, in true Russian style. In the
midst of all this merriment, which has been going on in his
absence, Tortsóff, the father, comes in with the bridegroom
of his choice. All the “vulgar” pleasures must now come to
an end, and the father, full of veneration for his fashionable
friend, curtly orders his daughter to marry the man he has
chosen for her. The tears of the girl and her mother are of no
avail: the father’s orders must be obeyed. But there enters
Lubím Tortsóff, in his rags and with his jester’s antics—terrible
in his degradation, and yet a man. The father’s terror
at such a sight can easily be imagined, and Lubím Tortsóff,
who during his wanderings has heard all about the Armenian’s
past, and who knows of his brother’s scheme, begins to
tell before the guests what sort of man the would-be bridegroom
is. The latter, holding himself insulted in his friend’s
house, affects great anger and leaves the room, while Lubím
Tortsóff tells his brother what a crime he is going to commit
by giving his daughter to the old man. He is ordered to leave
the room, but he persists and, standing in the rear of the
crowd, he begins piteously to beg: “Brother, give your
daughter to Mítya” (the young clerk): “he, at least, will
give me a corner in his house. I have suffered enough from
cold and hunger. My years are passing: it becomes hard for
me to get my piece of bread by performing my antics in the
bitter frost. Mítya will let me live honestly in my old age.”
The mother and daughter join with the uncle, and finally the
father, who resents the insults of his friend, exclaims: “Well,
do you take me, then, for a wild beast? I won’t give my
daughter to that man. Mítya, marry her!”</p>

<p>The drama has a happy end, but the audience feels that it
might have been as well the other way. The father’s whim
might have ended in the life-long misery and misfortune of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the daughter, and this would probably have been the outcome
in most such cases.</p>

<p>Like Griboyédoff’s comedy, like Gontcharóff’s <i>Oblómoff</i>,
and many other good things in Russian literature, this drama
is so typically Russian that one is apt to overlook its broadly
human signification. It seems to be typically Moscovite; but,
change names and customs, change a few details and rise a
bit higher or sink a bit lower in the strata of society; put,
instead of the drunkard Lubím Tortsóff, a poor relation or an
honest friend who has retained his common sense—and the
drama applies to any nation and to any class of society. It
is deeply human. This is what caused its tremendous success
and made it a favourite on every Russian stage for fifty years.
I do not speak, of course, of the foolishly exaggerated enthusiasm
with which it was received by the so-called nationalists,
and especially the Slavophiles, who saw in Lubím Tortsóff
the personification of the “good old times” of Russia. The
more sensible of Russians did not go to such lengths; but
they understood what wonderful material of observation,
drawn from real life, this and the other dramas of Ostróvskiy
were offering. The leading review of the time was <i>The Contemporary</i>,
and its leading critic, Dobrolúboff, wrote two
long articles to analyse Ostróvskiy’s dramas, under the significant
title of <i>The Kingdom of Darkness</i>; and when he had
passed in review all the darkness which then prevailed in
Russian life as represented by Ostróvskiy, he produced something
which has been one of the most powerful influences in
the whole subsequent intellectual development of the Russian
youth.</p>

<h3>“THE THUNDERSTORM”</h3>

<p>One of the best dramas of Ostróvskiy is <i>The Thunderstorm</i>
(translated by Mrs. Constance Garnett as <i>The Storm</i>).
The scene is laid in a small provincial town, somewhere on
the upper Vólga, where the manners of the local trades-people
have retained the stamp of primitive wildness. There
is, for instance, one old merchant, Dikóy, very much respected
by the inhabitants, who represents a special type of
those tyrants whom Ostróvskiy has so well depicted. Whenever
Dikóy has a payment to make, even though he knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
perfectly well that pay he must, he stirs up a quarrel with the
man to whom he is in debt. He has an old friend, Madame
Kabanóva, and when he is the worse for drink, and in a bad
temper, he always goes to her: “I have no business with
you,” he declares, “but I have been drinking.” Following
is a scene which takes place between them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: I really wonder at you; with all the crowd of folks in
your house, not a single one can do anything to your liking.</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: That’s so!</p>

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: Come, what do you want of me?</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: Well, talk me out of my temper. You’re the only person
in the whole town who knows how to talk to me.</p>

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: How have they put you into such a rage?</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: I’ve been so all day since the morning.</p>

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: I suppose they’ve been asking for money.</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: As if they were in league together, damn them! One after
another, the whole day long they’ve been at me.</p>

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: No doubt you’ll have to give it them, or they wouldn’t
persist.</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: I know that; but what would you have me do, since I’ve a
temper like that? Why, I know that I must pay, still I can’t do it
with a good will. You’re a friend of mine, and I’ve to pay you something,
and you come and ask me for it—I’m bound to swear at you!
Pay I will, if pay I must, but I must swear too. For you’ve only to
hint at money to me, and I feel hot all over in a minute; red-hot all
over, and that’s all about it. You may be sure at such times I’d swear
at anyone for nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Kabanóva</i>: You have no one over you, and so you think you can do
as you like.</p>

<p><i>Dikóy</i>: No, you hold your tongue! Listen to me! I’ll tell you the
sort of troubles that happen to me. I had fasted in Lent, and was all
ready for Communion, and then the Evil One thrusts a wretched
peasant under my nose. He had come for money, for wood he had
supplied us. And, for my sins, he must needs show himself at a time
like that! I fell into sin, of course; I pitched into him, pitched into
him finely, I did, all but thrashed him. There you have it, my temper!
Afterwards I asked his pardon, bowed down to his feet, upon my
word I did. It’s the truth I’m telling you, I bowed down to a peasant’s
feet. That’s what my temper brings me to: on the spot there, in the
mud I bowed down to his feet; before everyone, I did.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>
<p>Madame Kabanóva is well matched with Dikóy. She may
be less primitive than her friend, but she is an infinitely more
tyrannical oppressor. Her son is married and loves, more or
less, his young wife; but he is kept under his mother’s rule
just as if he were a boy. The mother hates, of course, the
young wife, Katerína, and tyrannises over her as much as she
can; and the husband has no energy to step in and defend her.
He is only too happy when he can slip away from the house.
He might have shown more love to his wife if they had been
living apart from his mother; but being in this house, always
under its tyrannical rule, he looks upon his wife as part of it
all. Katerína, on the contrary, is a poetical being. She was
brought up in a very good family, where she enjoyed full
liberty, before she married the young Kabanóff, and now she
feels very unhappy under the yoke of her terrible mother-in-law,
having nobody but a weakling husband to occasionally
say a word in her favour. There is also a little detail—she has
a mortal fear of thunderstorms. This is a feature which is
quite characteristic in the small towns on the upper Vólga: I
have myself known well educated ladies who, having once
been frightened by one of these sudden storms—they are of
a terrific grandeur—retained a life-long fear of thunder.</p>

<p>It so happens that Katerína’s husband has to leave his town
for a fortnight. Katerína, in the meantime, who has met
occasionally on the promenade a young man, Borís, a nephew
of Dikóy, and has received some attention from him, partly
driven to it by her husband’s sister—a very flighty girl, who
is wont to steal from the back garden to meet her sweethearts—has
during these few days one or two interviews with the
young man, and falls in love with him. Borís is the first man
who, since her marriage, has treated her with respect; he
himself suffers from the oppression of Dikóy, and she feels
half-sympathy, half-love towards him. But Borís is also of
weak, irresolute character, and as soon as his uncle Dikóy
orders him to leave the town he obeys and has only the usual
words of regret that “circumstances” so soon separate him
from Katerína. The husband returns, and when he, his wife,
and the old mother Kabanóva are caught by a terrific thunderstorm
on the promenade along the Vólga, Katerína, in mortal
fear of sudden death, tells in the presence of the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
which has taken refuge in a shelter on the promenade what
has happened during her husband’s absence. The consequences
will best be learned from the following scene, which I quote
from the same translation. It also takes place on the high
bank of the Vólga. After having wandered for some time in
the dusk on the solitary bank, Katerína at last perceives Borís
and runs up to him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Katerína</i>: At last I see you again! (<i>Weeps on his breast. Silence.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Well, God has granted us to weep together.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: You have not forgotten me?</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: How can you speak of forgetting?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Oh, no, it was not that, not that! You are not angry?</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Angry for what?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Forgive me! I did not mean to do you any harm. I was
not free myself. I did not know what I said, what I did.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Don’t speak of it! Don’t.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Well, how is it with you? What are you going to do?</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: I am going away.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Where are you going?</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Far away, Kátya, to Siberia.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Take me with you, away from here.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: I cannot, Kátya. I am not going of my free will; my uncle
is sending me, he has the horses waiting for me already; I only begged
for a minute, I wanted to take a last farewell of the spot where we
used to see each other.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Go, and God be with you! Don’t grieve over me. At first
your heart will be heavy, perhaps, poor boy, but then you will begin
to forget.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Why talk of me! I am free at least; how about you? what of
your husband’s mother?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: She tortures me, she locks me up. She tells everyone, even
my husband: “Don’t trust her, she is sly and deceitful.” They all
follow me about all day long, and laugh at me before my face. At
every word they reproach me with you.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: And your husband?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: One minute he’s kind, one minute he’s angry, but he’s
drinking all the while. He is loathsome to me, loathsome; his kindness
is worse than his blows.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: You are wretched, Kátya?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: So wretched, so wretched, that it were better to die!</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Who could have dreamed that we should have to suffer such
anguish for our love! I’d better have run away then!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: It was an evil day for me when I saw you. Joy I have
known little of, but of sorrow, of sorrow, how much! And how
much is still before me! But why think of what is to be! I am seeing
you now, that much they cannot take away from me; and I care
for nothing more. All I wanted was to see you. Now my heart is
much easier; as though a load had been taken off me. I kept thinking
you were angry with me, that you were cursing me....</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: How can you! How can you!</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: No, that is not what I mean; that is not what I wanted
to say! I was sick with longing for you, that’s it; and now, I have
seen you....</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: They must not come upon us here!</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Stay a minute! Stay a minute! Something I meant to say
to you! I’ve forgotten! Something I had to say! Everything is in confusion
in my head, I can remember nothing.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: It’s time I went, Kátya!</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Wait a minute, a minute!</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Come, what did you want to say?</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: I will tell you directly. (<i>Thinking a moment.</i>) Yes! As
you travel along the highroads, do not pass by one beggar, give to
everyone, and bid them pray for my sinful soul.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: Ah, if these people knew what it is to me to part from you!
My God! God grant they may one day know such bitterness as I know
now. Farewell, Kátya! (<i>Embraces her and tries to go away.</i>) Miscreants!
monsters! Ah, if I were strong!</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Stay, stay! Let me look at you for the last time (<i>gazes
into his face</i>). Now all is over with me. The end is come for me.
Now, God be with thee. Go, go quickly!</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: (<i>Moves away a few steps and stands still.</i>) Kátya, I feel a
dread of something! You have something fearful in your mind? I
shall be in torture as I go, thinking of you.</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: No, no! Go in God’s name! (<i>Borís is about to go up to
her.</i>) No, no, enough.</p>

<p><i>Borís</i>: (<i>Sobbing.</i>) God be with thee! There’s only one thing to
pray God for, that she may soon be dead, that she may not be tortured
long! Farewell!</p>

<p><i>Katerína</i>: Farewell!</p>

<p>(<i>Borís goes out. Katerína follows him with her eyes and stands for
some time, lost in thought.</i>)</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Katerína</span> (<i>alone</i>).</p>

<p>Where am I going now? Home? No, home or the grave—it is the
same. Yes, home or the grave!... the grave! Better the grave....
A little grave under a tree ... how sweet....
The sunshine warms it, the sweet rain falls on it ... in the
spring the grass grows on it, soft and sweet grass ... the birds
will fly in the tree and sing, and bring up their little ones, and flowers
will bloom; golden, red and blue ... all sorts of flowers,
(<i>dreamingly</i>) all sorts of flowers ... how still! how sweet!
My heart is as it were lighter! But of life I don’t want to think! Live
again! No, no, no use ... life is not good!... And
people are hateful to me, and the house is hateful, and the walls are
hateful! I will not go there! No, no, I will not go! if I go to them,
they’ll come and talk, and what do I want with that? Ah, it has
grown dark! And there is singing again somewhere! What are they
singing? I can’t make out.... To die now.... What
are they singing? It is just the same whether death comes, or of
myself ... but live I cannot! A sin to die so!... they
won’t pray for me! If anyone loves me, he will pray ... they
will fold my arms crossed in the grave! Oh, yes.... I remember.
But when they catch me, and take me home by force....
Ah, quickly, quickly! (<i>Goes to the river bank. Aloud.</i>) My dear one!
My sweet! Farewell!</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Thunderstorm</i> is one of the best dramas in the modern
répertoire of the Russian stage. From the stage point of view
it is simply admirable. Every scene is impressive, the drama
develops rapidly, and every one of the twelve characters introduced
in it is a joy to the dramatic artist. The parts of Dikóy,
Varvára (the frivolous sister), Kabanóff, Kudryásh (the
sweetheart of Varvára), an old artisan-engineer, nay even
the old lady with two male-servants, who appears only for a
couple of minutes—each one will be found a source of deep
artistic pleasure by the actor or actress who takes it; while
the parts of Katerína and Mme. Kabanóva are such that no
great actress would neglect them.</p>

<p>Concerning the main idea of the drama, I shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
repeat here what I have already said once or twice in the
course of these sketches. At first sight it may seem that Mme.
Kabanóva and her son are exclusively Russian types—types
which exist no more in Western Europe. So it was said, at
least, by several English critics. But such an assertion seems
to be hardly correct. The submissive Kabanóffs may be rare
in England, or at least their sly submissiveness does not go
to the same lengths as it does in <i>The Thunderstorm</i>. But even
for Russian society Kabanóff is not very typical. As to
his mother, Mme. Kabanóva, every one of us must have
met her more than once in English surroundings. Who does
not know, indeed, the old lady who for the mere pleasure of
exercising her power will keep her daughters at her side, prevent
their marrying, and tyrannise over them till they have
grown grey-haired? or in thousands or other ways exercise
her tyranny over her household? Dickens knew Mme.
Kabanóva well, and she is still alive in these Islands, as everywhere
else.</p>

<h3>OSTRÓVSKIY’S LATER DRAMAS</h3>

<p>As Ostróvskiy advanced in years and widened the scope of
his observations of Russian life, he drew his characters from
other circles besides that of the merchants, and in his later
dramas he gave such highly attractive, progressive types as
<i>The Poor Bride</i>, Parásha (in a beautiful comedy, <i>An Impetuous
Heart</i>), Agniya in <i>Carnival has its End</i>, the actor Neschastlívtseff
(Mr. Unfortunate) in a charming idyll, <i>The
Forest</i>, and so on. And as regards his “negative” (undesirable)
types, taken from the life of the St. Petersburg bureaucracy
or from the millionaire and “company-promoters”
circles, Ostróvskiy deeply understood them and attained the
artistic realisation of wonderfully true, coldly-harsh, though
apparently “respectable” types, such as no other dramatic
writer has ever succeeded in producing.</p>

<p>Altogether Ostróvskiy wrote about fifty dramas and
comedies, and every one of them is excellent for the stage.
There are no insignificant parts in them. A great actor or
actress may take one of the smallest parts, consisting of perhaps
but a few words pronounced during a few minutes’
appearance on the stage—and yet feel that there is material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
enough in it to create a character. As for the main personages,
Ostróvskiy fully understood that a considerable part in the
creation of a character must be left to the actor. There are
consequently parts which without such a collaboration would
be pale and unfinished, while in the hands of a true actor they
yield material for a deeply psychological and profoundly
dramatic personification. This is why a lover of dramatic art
finds such a deep æsthetic pleasure both in playing in Ostróvskiy’s
dramas and in reading them aloud.</p>

<p>Realism, in the sense which already has been indicated
several times in these pages—that is, a realistic description
of characters and events, subservient to ideal aims—is the distinctive
feature of all Ostróvskiy’s dramas. As in the novels
of Turguéneff, the simplicity of his plots is striking. But you
see life—true life with all its pettinesses—developing before
you, and out of these petty details grows insensibly the
plot.</p>

<p>“One scene follows another, and all of them are so commonplace,
such an everyday matter!—and yet, out of them,
a terrible drama has quite imperceptibly grown into being.
You could affirm that it is not a comedy being played before
you, but life itself unrolled before your eyes—as if the
author had simply opened a wall and shown you what is
going on inside this or that house.” In these just words one
of our critics, Skabitchévskiy, has described Ostróvskiy’s
work.</p>

<p>In his dramas Ostróvskiy introduced an immense variety
of characters taken from all classes of Russian life; but he
once for all abandoned the old romantic division of human
types into “good” and “bad” ones. In real life these two
divisions are blended together and merge into another; and
while even now an English dramatic author cannot conceive a
drama without “the villain,” Ostróvskiy never felt the need
of introducing that conventional personage. Nor did he feel
the need of resorting to the conventional rules of “dramatic
conflict.” To quote once more from the same critic:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is no possibility of bringing his comedies under some general
principle, such as a struggle of duty against inclination, or a
collision of passions which calls forth a fatal result, or an antagonism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
between good and evil, or between progress and ignorance. His comedies
represent the most varied human relations. Just as we find it in
life, men stand in these comedies in different obligatory relations
towards each other, which relations have, of course, their origin in the
past; and when these men have been brought together, conflicts necessarily
arise between them, out of these very relations. As to the outcome
of the conflict, it is, as a rule quite unforeseen, and often
depends, as usually happens in real life, upon mere accidents.”</p>
</div>

<p>Like Ibsen, Ostróvskiy sometimes will not even undertake
to say how the drama will end.</p>

<p>And finally, Ostróvskiy, notwithstanding the pessimism of
all his contemporaries—the writers of the forties—was not a
pessimist. Even amidst the most terrible conflicts depicted in
his dramas he retained the sense of the joy of life and of the
unavoidable fatality of many of the miseries of life. He never
recoiled before painting the darker aspects of the human turmoil,
and he has given a most repulsive collection of family-despots
from the old merchant class, followed by a collection
of still more repulsive types from the class of industrial
“promoters.” But in one way or another he managed
either to show that there are better influences at work, or, at
least, to suggest the possible triumph of some better element.
He thus avoided falling into the pessimism which characterised
his contemporaries, and he had nothing of the hysterical
turn of mind which we find in some of his modern followers.
Even at moments when, in some one of his dramas, life
all round wears the gloomiest aspect (as, for instance, in <i>Sin
and Misfortune may visit everyone</i>, which is a page from
peasant life as realistically dark, but better suited for the
stage, than Tolstóy’s <i>Power of Darkness</i>), even then a gleam
of hope appears, at least, in the contemplation of nature,
if nothing else remains to redeem the gloominess of human
folly.</p>

<p>And yet, there is one thing—and a very important one—which
stands in the way of Ostróvskiy’s occupying in international
dramatic literature the high position to which his
powerful dramatic talent entitled him, and being recognised
as one of the great dramatists of our century. The dramatic
conflicts which we find in his dramas are all of the simpler
sort. There are none of the more tragical problems and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
entanglements which the complicated nature of the educated
man of our own times and the different aspects of the great
social questions are giving birth to in the conflicts arising now
in every stratum and class of society. But it must also be said
that the dramatist who can treat these modern problems of
life in the same masterly way in which the Moscow writer
has treated the simpler problems which he saw in his own
surroundings, is yet to come.</p>

<h3>HISTORICAL DRAMAS—A. K. TOLSTÓY.</h3>

<p>At a later period of his life Ostróvskiy turned to historical
drama, which he wrote in excellent blank verse. But, like
Shakespeare’s plays from English history, and Púshkin’s
<i>Borís Godunóff</i>, they have more the character of dramatised
chronicles than of dramas properly speaking. They belong
too much to the domain of the epic, and the dramatic interest
is too often sacrificed to the desire of introducing historical
colouring.</p>

<p>The same is true, though in a lesser degree, of the historical
dramas of Count <span class="smcap">Alexéi Konstantínovitch Tolstóy</span>
(1817-1875). A. K. Tolstóy was above all a poet; but he also
wrote a historical novel from the times of John the Terrible,
<i>Prince Serébryanyi</i>, which had a very great success, partly
because in it for the first time censorship had permitted fiction
to deal with the half-mad Tsar who played the part of the
Louis XI. of the Russian Monarchy, but especially on account
of its real qualities as a historical novel. He also tried his
talent in a dramatic poem, <i>Don Juan</i>, much inferior, however,
to Púshkin’s drama dealing with the same subject; but his
main work was a trilogy of three tragedies from the times of
John the Terrible and the imposter Demetrius: <i>The Death of
John the Terrible</i>, <i>The Tsar Theódor Ivánovitch</i>, and <i>Borís
Godunóff</i>.</p>

<p>These three tragedies have a considerable value; in each
the situation of the hero is really highly dramatic, and treated
in a most impressive way, while the settings in the palaces of
the old Moscow Tsars are extremely decorative and impressive
in their sumptuous originality. But in all three tragedies
the development of the dramatic element suffers from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
intrusion of the epical descriptive element, and the characters
are either not quite correct historically (Borís Godunóff is
deprived of his rougher traits in favour of a certain quiet
idealism which was a personal feature of the author), or they
do not represent that entireness of character which we are
accustomed to find in Shakespeare’s dramas. Of course, the
tragedies of Tolstóy’s are extremely far from the romanticism
of the dramas of Victor Hugo; they are, all things considered,
realistic dramas; but in the framing of the human characters
some romanticism is felt still, and this is especially evident
in the construction of the character of John the Terrible.</p>

<p>An exception must, however, be made in favour of <i>The
Tsar Theódor Ivánovitch</i>. A. K. Tolstóy was a devoted personal
friend of Alexander II. and, refusing all administrative
posts of honour which were offered him, he preferred the
modest position of a Head of the Imperial Hunt, which permitted
him to retain his independence, while remaining in
close contact with the Emperor. Owing to this intimacy he
must have had the best opportunities for observing, especially
in the later years of Alexander II.’s reign, the struggles to
which a good-hearted man of weak character is exposed when
he is a Tsar of Russia. Of course the Tsar Theódor is not in
the least an attempt at portraying Alexander II.—this would
have been beneath an artist—but the weakness of Alexander’s
character must have suggested those features of reality in the
character of Theódor which makes it so much better painted
than either John the Terrible or Borís Godunóff. The Tsar
Theódor is a really living creation.</p>

<h3>OTHER DRAMATIC WRITERS</h3>

<p>Of other writers for the stage, we can only briefly mention
the most interesting ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turguéneff</span> wrote, in 1848-1851, five comedies, which
offer all the elements for refined acting, are very lively and,
being written in a beautiful style (Turguéneff’s prose!), are
still the source of æsthetic pleasure for the more refined playgoers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sukhovó-Kobýlin</span> has already been mentioned. He wrote
one comedy, <i>The Marriage of Kretchínskiy</i>, which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
its mark and is still played with success, and a trilogy, <i>The
Affair</i>, which is a powerful satire against bureaucracy, but is
less effective on the stage than the former.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Písemskiy</span>, the novelist (1820-1881), wrote, besides
a few good novels and several insignificant comedies, one
remarkably good drama—<i>A Bitter Fate</i>, from the peasants’
life, which he knew well and rendered admirably. It must be
said that Leo Tolstóy’s well known <i>Power of Darkness</i>—taken
also from peasant life—notwithstanding all its power,
has not eclipsed the drama of Písemskiy.</p>

<p>The novelist <span class="smcap">A. A. Potyékhin</span> (1829-1902) also wrote
for the stage, and must not be omitted even in such a rapid
sketch of the Russian drama as this. His comedies, <i>Tinsel</i>,
<i>A Slice Cut-off</i>, <i>A Vacant Situation</i>, <i>In Muddy Waters</i>, met
with the greatest difficulties as regards censorship, and the
third was never put on the stage; but those which were played
were always a success, while the themes that he treated always
attracted the attention of our critics. The first of them, <i>Tinsel</i>,
can be taken as a fair representative of the talent of
Potyékhin.</p>

<p>This comedy answered a “question of the day.” For several
years Russian literature, following especially in the
steps of <span class="smcap">Schedrin</span> (see Ch. VIII.), delighted in the description
of those functionaries of the Government boards and
tribunals who lived (before the reforms of the sixties) almost
entirely upon bribes. However, after the reforms had
been carried through, a new race of functionaries had grown
up, “those who took no bribes,” but at the same time, owing
to their strait-laced official rigorism, and their despotic and
unbridled egotism, were even worse specimens of mankind
than any of the “bribe-takers” of old. The hero of <i>Tinsel</i> is
precisely such a man. His character, with all its secondary
features—his ingratitude and especially his love (or what
passes for love in him)—is perhaps too much blackened for
the purposes of the drama: men so consistently egotistical and
formalistic are seldom, if ever, met with in real life. But one
is almost convinced by the author of the reality of the type—with
so masterly a hand does he unroll in a variety of
incidents the “correct” and deeply egotistic nature of his
hero.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
In this respect the comedy is very clever, and offers full opportunity
for excellent acting.</p>

<p>A dramatic writer who enjoyed a long-standing success was
<span class="smcap">A. I. Palm</span> (1823-1885). In 1849 he was arrested for
having frequented persons belonging to the circle of Petrashévskiy
(see <span class="smcap">Dostoyévskiy</span>), and from that time his life
was a series of misfortunes, so that he returned to literary
activity only at the age of fifty. He belonged to the generation
of Turguéneff, and, knowing well that type of noblemen,
whom the great novelist has depicted so well in his <i>Hamlets</i>,
he wrote several comedies from the life of their circles. <i>The
Old Nobleman</i> and <i>Our Friend Neklúzheff</i> were till lately
favourite plays on the stage. The actor, <span class="smcap">I. E. Tchernyshófe</span>,
who wrote several comedies and one serious drama,
<i>A Spoiled Life</i>, which produced a certain impression in 1861;
<span class="smcap">N. Solovióff</span>, and a very prolific writer, <span class="smcap">V. A. Krylóff</span>
(<span class="smcap">Alexándroff</span>), must also be mentioned in this brief
sketch.</p>

<p>And finally, two young writers have brought out lately
comedies and dramatic scenes which have produced a deep
sensation. I mean <span class="smcap">Anton Tchéhoff</span>, whose drama <i>Ivánoff</i>
was a few years ago the subject of the most passionate discussions,
and <span class="smcap">Maxím Górkiy</span>, whose drama, <i>The Artisans</i>, undoubtedly
reveals a dramatic talent, while his just published
“dramatic scenes,” <i>At the Bottom</i>—they are only scenes,
without an attempt at building a drama—are extremely
powerful, and even eclipse his best sketches. More will be
said of them in the next chapter.</p>

</div>


<p>An important division of Russian novelists, almost totally
unknown in Western Europe, and yet representing
perhaps the most typical portion of Russian literature,
are the “Folk-Novelists.” It is under this name that we
know them chiefly in Russia, and under this name the critic
Skabitchévskiy has analysed them—first, in a book bearing
this title, and then in his excellent <i>History of Modern
Russian Literature</i> (4th ed. 1900). By “Folk-Novelists”
we mean, of course, not those who write <i>for</i> the people, but
those who write <i>about</i> the people: the peasants, the miners,
the factory workers, the lowest strata of population in towns,
the tramps. Bret Harte in his sketches of the mining camps,
Zola in <i>L’Assommoir</i> and <i>Germinal</i>, Mr. Gissing in <i>Liza of
Lambeth</i>, Mr. Whiting in <i>No. 5 John Street</i>, belong to this
category; but what is exceptional and accidental in Western
Europe is organic in Russia.</p>

<p>Quite a number of talented writers have devoted themselves
during the last fifty years, some of them entirely, to the
description of this or that division of the Russian people.
Every class of the toiling masses, which in other literatures
would have appeared in novels as the background for events
going on amidst educated people (as in Hardy’s <i>Woodlanders</i>),
has had in the Russian novel its own painter. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
great questions concerning popular life which are debated in
political and social books and reviews have been treated in
the novel as well. The evils of serfdom and, later on, the
struggle between the tiller of the soil and growing commercialism;
the effects of factories upon village life, the great
coöperative fisheries, peasant life in certain monasteries, and
life in the depths of the Siberian forests, slum life and tramp
life—all these have been depicted by the folk-novelists, and
their novels have been as eagerly read as the works of the
greatest authors. And while such questions as, for instance,
the future of the village-community, or of the peasants’ Common
Law Courts, are debated in the daily papers, in the
scientific reviews and the journals of statistical research, they
are also dealt with by means of artistic images and types
taken from life in the folk-novel.</p>

<p>Moreover, the folk-novelists, taken as a whole, represent
a great school of realism in art, and in true realism they have
surpassed all those writers who have been mentioned in the
preceding chapters. Of course, Russian “realism,” as the
reader of this book is already well aware, is something quite
different from what was represented as “naturalism” and
“realism” in France by Zola. As already remarked, Zola,
notwithstanding his propaganda of realism, always remained
an inveterate romantic in the conception of his
leading characters, both of the “saint” and of the “villain”
type; and no doubt because of this—perhaps feeling it himself—he
gave, as a compensation, such an exaggerated importance
to speculations about physiological heredity and
to the accumulation of pretty descriptive details, many of
which, especially amongst his repulsive types, might have been
omitted without depriving the characters of any really significant
feature. In Russia the “realism” of Zola has always
been considered too superficial, too outward, and while our
folk-novelists also have often indulged in an unnecessary
profusion of detail—sometimes decidedly ethnographical—they
have aimed nevertheless at that <i>inner</i> realism which
appears in the construction of such characters as are really
representative of life taken as a whole. Their aim has been
to represent life without distortion—whether that distortion
consists in introducing petty details, which may be true, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
are accidental, or in endowing heroes with virtues or vices
which are indeed met with here and there, but ought not to
be generalised. Several novelists, as will be seen presently,
have objected even to the usual ways of describing <i>types</i> and
relating the individual dramas of a few typical heroes. They
have made the extremely bold attempt of describing <i>life itself</i>,
in its succession of petty actions, moving on amidst its grey
and dull surroundings, introducing only that dramatic element
which results from the endless succession of petty and depressing
details and wonted circumstances; and it must be
owned that they have not been quite unsuccessful in striking
out this new line of art—perhaps the most tragical of all.
Others, again, have introduced a new type of artistic representation
of life, which occupies an intermediate position between
the novel, properly so-called, and a demographic description
of a given population. Thus, Gleb Uspénskiy knew
how to intermingle artistic descriptions of typical village-people
with discussions belonging to the domain of folk-psychology
in so interesting a manner that the reader willingly
pardons him these digressions; while others like Maxímoff
succeeded in making out of their ethnographical descriptions
real works of art, without in the least diminishing their
scientific value.</p>

<h3>THE EARLY FOLK-NOVELISTS</h3>

<p>One of the earliest folk-novelists was <span class="smcap">Grigoróvitch</span>
(1822-1899), a man of great talent, who sometimes is
placed by the side of Tolstóy, Turguéneff, Gontcharóff and
Ostróvskiy. His literary career was very interesting. He was
born of a Russian father and a French mother, and at the
age of ten hardly knew Russian at all. His education was
entirely foreign—chiefly French—and he never really lived
the village life amidst which Turguéneff or Tolstóy grew up.
Moreover, he never gave himself exclusively to literature:
he was a painter as well as a novelist, and at the same time
a fine connoisseur of art, and for the last thirty years of his
life he wrote almost nothing, but gave all his time to the
Russian Society of Painters. And yet this half-Russian was
one of those who rendered the same service to Russia before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the abolition of serfdom that Harriet Beecher Stowe
rendered to the United States by her description of the
sufferings of the negro slaves.</p>

<p>Grigoróvitch was educated in the same military school of
engineers as was Dostoyévskiy, and after having finished his
education there, he took a tiny room from the warder of the
Academy of Arts, with the intention of giving himself entirely
to art. However, in the studios he made the acquaintance
of the Little Russian poet Shevtchénko, and next of
Nekrásoff and Valerián Máykoff (a critic of great power,
who died very young), and through them he found his vocation
in literature.</p>

<p>In the early forties he was known only by a charming
sketch, <i>The Organ Grinders</i>, in which he spoke with great
warmth of feeling of the miserable life of this class of the
St. Petersburg population. Russian society, in those years,
felt the impression of the Socialist revival of France, and
its best representatives were growing impatient with serfdom
and absolutism. Fourier and Pierre Leroux were favourite
writers in advanced intellectual circles, and Grigoróvitch was
carried on by the growing current. He left St. Petersburg,
went to stay for a year or two in the country, and in 1846
he published his first novel dealing with country life, <i>The
Village</i>. He depicted in it, without any exaggeration, the
dark sides of village life and the horrors of serfdom, and
he did it so vividly that Byelínskiy, the critic, at once recognised
in him a new writer of great power, and greeted him
as such. His next novel, <i>Antón the Unfortunate</i>, also drawn
from village life, was a tremendous success, and its influence
was almost equal to that of <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>. No
educated man or woman of his generation or of ours could
have read the book without weeping over the misfortunes
of Antón, and finding better feelings growing in his heart
towards the serfs. Several novels of the same character followed
in the next eight years (1847 to 1855)—<i>The Fishermen</i>,
<i>The Immigrants</i>, <i>The Tiller</i>, <i>The Tramp</i>, <i>The Country
Roads</i>—and then Grigoróvitch came to a stop. In 1865 he
took part with some of our best writers—Gontcharóff,
Ostróvskiy, Maxímoff (the ethnographer), and several
others—in a literary expedition organised by the Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Duke Constantine for the exploration of Russia and voyages
round the world on board ships of the Navy. Grigoróvitch
made a very interesting sea-voyage; but his sketches of travel—<i>The
Ship Retvizan</i>—cannot be compared with Gontcharóff’s
<i>Frigate Pallas</i>. On returning from the expedition
he abandoned literature to devote himself entirely to art,
and he subsequently brought out only a couple of novels and
his <i>Reminiscences</i>. He died in 1899.</p>

<p>Grigoróvitch thus published all his chief novels between
the years 1846 and 1855. Opinion about his work is divided.
Some of our critics speak of it very highly, but others—and
they are the greater number—say that his peasants are not
quite real. Turguéneff made also the observation that his
descriptions are too cold: the heart is not felt in them. This
last remark may be true, although the average reader who
did not know Grigoróvitch personally hardly would have
made it: at any rate, at the time of the appearance of <i>Antón</i>,
<i>The Fishermen</i>, etc., the great public judged the author of
these works differently. As to his peasants, I will permit
myself to make one suggestion. Undoubtedly they are slightly
idealised; but it must also be said that the Russian peasantry
does not present a compact, uniform mass. Several races have
settled upon the territory of European Russia, and different
portions of the population have followed different lines of
development. The peasant from South Russia is quite different
from the Northerner, and the Western peasants
differ in every respect from the Eastern ones. Grigoróvitch
described chiefly those living directly south of Moscow, in
the provinces of Túla and Kalúga, and they are exactly that
mild and slightly poetical, downtrodden and yet inoffensive,
good-hearted race of peasants that Grigoróvitch described in
his novels—a sort of combination of the Lithuanian and
the Little-Russian poetical mind, with the Great-Russian
communal spirit. Ethnographers themselves see in the populations
of this part of Russia a special ethnographical
division.</p>

<p>Of course, Turguéneff’s peasants (Túla and Oryól) are
more real, his types are more definite, and every one of the
modern folk-novelists, even of the less talented, has gone
much further than Grigoróvitch did into the depths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
peasant character and life. But such as they were, the novels
of Grigoróvitch exercised a profound influence on a whole
generation. They made us love the peasants and feel how
heavy was the indebtedness towards them which weighed
upon us—the educated part of society. They powerfully contributed
towards creating a general feeling in favour of the
serfs, without which the abolition of serfdom would have
certainly been delayed for many years to come, and assuredly
would not have been so sweeping as it was. And at a later
epoch his work undoubtedly contributed to the creation of
that movement “towards the people” (<i>v naród</i>) which took
place in the seventies. As to the literary influence of Grigoróvitch,
it was such that it may be questioned whether Turguéneff
would ever have been bold enough to write as he
did about the peasants, in his <i>Sportsman’s Note Book</i>, or
Nekrásoff to compose his passionate verses about the people,
if they had not had a forerunner in him.</p>

<p>Another writer of the same school, who also produced
a deep impression on the very eve of the liberation of the
serfs, was <span class="smcap">Mme. Marie Márkovitch</span>, who wrote under the
pseudonym of <span class="smcap">Márko Vovtchók</span>. She was a Great Russian—her
parents belonged to the nobility of Central Russia—but
she married the Little-Russian writer, <span class="smcap">Márkovitch</span>,
and her first book of stories from peasant-life (1857-58)
was written in excellent Little Russian. (Turguéneff translated
them into Great Russian.) She soon returned, however,
to her native tongue, and her second book of peasant stories,
as well as her subsequent novels from the life of the educated
classes, were written in Great Russian.</p>

<p>At the present time the novels of Márko Vovtchók may
seem to be too sentimental—the world-famed novel of Harriett
Beecher Stowe produces the same impression nowadays—but
in those years, when the great question for Russia was
whether the serfs should be freed or not, and when all the
best forces of the country were needed for the struggle
in favour of their emancipation—in those years all educated
Russia read the novels of Márko Vovtchók with
delight, and wept over the fate of her peasant heroines.
However, apart from this need of the moment—and art
is bound to be at the service of society in such crises—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
sketches of Márko Vovtchók had serious qualities. Their
“sentimentalism” was not the sentimentalism of the beginning
of the nineteenth century, behind which was concealed
an absence of real feeling. A loving heart throbbed in
them; and there is in them real poetry, inspired by the poetry
of the Ukraïnian folklore and its popular songs. With these,
Mme. Márkovitch was so familiar that, as has been remarked
by Russian critics, she supplemented her imperfect knowledge
of real popular life by introducing in a masterly manner
many features inspired by the folklore and the popular songs
of Little Russia. Her heroes were invented, but the atmosphere
of a Little-Russian village, the colours of local life,
are in these sketches; and the soft poetical sadness of the
Little-Russian peasantry is rendered with the tender touch
of a woman’s hand.</p>

<p>Among the novelists of that period <span class="smcap">Danilévskiy</span> (1829-1890)
must also be mentioned. Although he is better known
as a writer of historical romances, his three long novels, <i>The
Runaways in Novoróssiya</i> (1862), <i>Freedom, or The Runways
Returned</i> (1863), and <i>New Territories</i> (1867)—all
dealing with the free settlers in Bessarabia—were widely
read. They contain lively and very sympathetic scenes from
the life of these settlers—mostly runaway serfs—who occupied
the free lands, without the consent of the central government,
in the newly annexed territories of southwestern
Russia, and became the prey of enterprising adventurers.</p>

<h3>INTERMEDIATE PERIOD</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding all the qualities of their work, Grigoróvitch
and Márko Vovtchók failed to realise that the very
fact of taking the life of the poorer classes as the subject of
novels, ought to imply the working out of a special literary
manner. The usual literary technique evolved for the novel
which deals with the leisured classes—with its mannerism,
its “heroes,” poetised now, as the knights used to be poetised
in the tales of chivalry—is certainly not the most appropriate
for novels treating the life of American squatters or Russian
peasants. New methods and a different style had to be
worked out; but this was done step by step only, and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
be extremely interesting to show this gradual evolution, from
Grigoróvitch to the ultra-realism of Ryeshétnikoff, and finally
to the perfection of form attained by the realist-idealist
Górkiy in his shorter sketches. Only a few intermediate steps
can, however, be indicated in these pages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. T. Kókoreff</span> (1826-1853), who died very young,
after having written a few tales from the life of the petty
artisans in towns, had not freed himself from the sentimentalism
of a benevolent outsider; but he knew this life
from the inside: he was born and brought up in great poverty
among these very people; consequently, the artisans in his
novels are real beings, described, as Dobrolúboff said, “with
warmth and yet with tender restraint, as if they were his
nearest kin.” However, “No shriek of despair, no mighty
wrath, no mordant irony came out of this tender, patiently
suffering heart.” There is even a note of reconciliation with
the social inequalities.</p>

<p>A considerable step in advance was made by the folk-novel
in <span class="smcap">A. Th. Písemskiy</span> (1820-1881), and <span class="smcap">A. A. Potyékhinn</span>
(born 1829), although neither of them was exclusively
a folk-novelist. Písemskiy was a contemporary of
Turguéneff, and at a certain time of his career it seemed
as if he were going to take a place by the side of Turguéneff,
Tolstóy and Gontcharóff. He undoubtedly possessed
a great talent. There was power and real life in whatever
he wrote, and his novel, <i>A Thousand Souls</i>, appearing on the
eve of the emancipation of the serfs (1858), produced a
deep impression. It was fully appreciated in Germany as
well, where it was translated the next year. But Písemskiy
was not a man of principle, and this novel was his last serious
and really good production. When the great Radical and
Nihilist movement took place (1858-1864), and it became
necessary to take a definite position amidst the sharp conflict
of opinions, Písemskiy, who was deeply pessimistic in his
judgment of men and ideas, and considered “opinions” as
a mere cover for narrow egotism of the lowest sensual sort,
took a hostile position towards this movement, and wrote
such novels as <i>The Unruly Sea</i>, which were mere libels
upon the young generation. This was, of course, the death
of his by no means ordinary talent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Písemskiy wrote also, during the early part of his literary
career, a few tales from the life of the peasants (<i>The Carpenters’
Artel</i>, <i>The St. Petersburg Man</i>, etc.), and a drama,
from village life, <i>A Bitter Fate</i>, all of which have a real
literary value. He displayed in them a knowledge of peasant
life and a mastery of the spoken, popular Russian language,
together with a perfectly realistic perception of peasant character.
There was no trace of the idealisation which is so
strongly felt in the later productions of Grigoróvitch, written
under the influence of George Sand. The steady, common-sense
peasant characters that Písemskiy pictured are taken
from a real, sound observation of life, and rival the best
peasant characters of Turguéneff. As to the drama of
Písemskiy (he was, by the way, a very good actor), it loses
nothing from comparison with the best dramas of Ostróvskiy,
and is more tragic than any of them, while in powerful
realism it is by no means inferior to Tolstóy’s <i>Power of
Darkness</i>, with which it has much in common, and which it
perhaps surpasses in its stage qualities.</p>

<p>The chief work of Potyékhin was his comedies, mentioned
in the preceding chapter. All of them are from the
life of the educated classes, but he wrote also a few less
known dramas from the peasant life, and twice—in his early
career in the fifties, and later on in the seventies—he turned
to the writing of short stories and novels from popular
life.</p>

<p>These stories and novels are most characteristic of the evolution
of the folk-novel during those years. In his earlier tales
Potyékhin was entirely under the spell of the then prevailing
manner of idealising the peasants; but in his second period,
after having lived through the years of realism in the sixties,
and taken part in the above-mentioned ethnographic expedition,
he changed his manner. He entirely got rid of benevolent
idealisation, and represented the peasants as they were.
In the creation of individual characters he was undoubtedly
successful, but the life of the village—the <i>mir</i>—without
which Russian village-life cannot be represented, and which
so well appears in the works of the later folk-novelists, is
yet missing. Altogether one feels that Potyékhin knew well
the outer symptoms of the life of the Russian peasants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
including their way of talking, but that he had not yet
grasped the real soul of the peasant. This came only later on.</p>

<h3>ETHNOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH</h3>

<p>Serfdom was abolished in 1861, and the time for mere
lamentation over its evils was gone. Proof that the peasants
were human beings, accessible to all human feelings, was
no longer needed. New and far deeper problems concerning
the life and ideals of the Russian people rose before every
thinking Russian. Here was a mass of nearly fifty million
people, whose manners of life, whose creed, ways of thinking,
and ideals were totally different from those of the
educated classes, and who at the same time were as unknown
to the would-be leaders of progress as if these millions spoke
a quite different language and belonged to a quite different
race.</p>

<p>Our best men felt that all the future development of
Russia would be hampered by that ignorance, if it continued—and
literature did its best to answer the great
questions which besieged the thinking man at every step
of his social and political activity.</p>

<p>The years 1858-1878 were years of the ethnographical
exploration of Russia on such a scale that nowhere in Europe
or America do we find anything similar. The monuments of
old folklore and poetry; the common law of different parts
and nationalities of the Empire; the religious beliefs and
the forms of worship, and still more the social aspirations
characteristic of the many sections of dissenters; the
extremely interesting habits and customs which prevail in
the different provinces; the economical conditions of the
peasants; their domestic trades; the immense communal fisheries
n southeastern Russia; the thousands of forms taken
by the popular coöperative organisations (the <i>Artels</i>); the
“inner colonisation” of Russia, which can only be compared
with that of the United States; the evolution of ideas of
landed property, and so on—all these became the subjects
of extensive research.</p>

<p>The great ethnographical expedition organised by the
Grand Duke Constantine, in which a number of our best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
writers took part, was only the forerunner of many expeditions,
great and small, which were organised by the numerous
Russian scientific societies for the detailed study of Russia’s
ethnography, folklore, and economics. There were men like
<span class="smcap">Yakúshkin</span> (1820-1872), who devoted all his life to wandering
on foot from village to village, dressed like the
poorest peasant, and without any sort of thought of to-morrow;
drying his wet peasant cloth on his shoulders after a
day’s march under the rain, living with the peasants in
their poor huts, and collecting folk-songs or ethnographic
material of the highest value.</p>

<p>A special type of the Russian “intellectuals” developed
in the so-called “Song-Collectors,” and “Zemstvo Statisticians,”
a group of people, old and young, who during the
last twenty-five years have as volunteers and at a ridiculously
small price, devoted their lives to house-to-house
inquiry in behalf of the County Councils. (A. Oertel has
admirably described these “Statisticians” in one of his
novels.)</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that, according to <span class="smcap">A. N. Pýpin</span>, the author
of an exhaustive <i>History of Russian Ethnography</i> (4 vols.),
not less than 4000 large works and bulky review articles
were published during the twenty years, 1858-1878, half
of them dealing with the economical conditions of the
peasants, and the other half with ethnography in its wider
sense; and research still continues on the same scale. The
best of all this movement has been that it has not ended in
dead material in official publications. Some of the reports, like
<span class="smcap">Maxímoff’s</span> <i>A Year in the North</i>, <i>Siberia and Hard Labour</i>,
and <i>Tramping Russia</i>, <span class="smcap">Afanásieff</span> (<i>Legends</i>), <span class="smcap">Zheleznóff’s</span>
<i>Ural Cossacks</i>, <span class="smcap">Mélnikoff’s</span> (<span class="smcap">Petchérsky</span>), <i>In
the Woods</i> and <i>On the Mountains</i>, or <span class="smcap">Mordóvtseff’s</span> many
sketches, were so well written that they were as widely read
as the best novels; while the dry statistical reports were
summed up in lively review articles (in Russia the reviews
are much more bulky, and the articles much longer than in
England), which were widely read and discussed all over
the country. Besides, admirable researches dealing with
special classes of people, regions, and institutions were made
by men like <span class="smcap">Prugávin</span>, <span class="smcap">Zasódimskiy</span>, <span class="smcap">Pyzhóff</span> (<i>History<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
of the Public Houses</i>, which is in fact a popular history of
Russia).</p>

<p>Russian educated society, which formerly hardly knew the
peasants otherwise than from the balcony of their country
houses, was thus brought in a few years into a close intercourse
with all divisions of the toiling masses; and it is easy
to understand the influence which this intercourse exercised,
not only upon the development of political ideas, but also
upon the whole character of Russian literature.</p>

<p>The idealised novel of the past was now outgrown. The
representation of “the dear peasants” as a background for
opposing their idyllic virtues to the defects of the educated
classes was possible no more. The taking of the people as
a mere material for burlesque tales, as <span class="smcap">Nicholas Uspénskiy</span>
and <span class="smcap">V. A. Slyeptsóff</span> tried to do, enjoyed but a momentary
success. A new, eminently realistic school of folk-novelists
was wanted. And the result was the appearance of quite a
number of writers who broke new ground and, by cultivating
a very high conception concerning the duties of art in the
representation of the poorer, uneducated classes, opened, I
am inclined to think, a new page in the evolution of the
novel for the literature of all nations.</p>

<h3>POMYALÓVSKIY</h3>

<p>The clergy in Russia—that is, the priests, the deacons, the
cantors, the bell-ringers—represent a separate class which
stands between “the classes” and “the masses”—much
nearer to the latter than to the former. This is especially true
as regards the clergy in the villages, and it was still more so
some fifty years ago. Receiving no salary, the village priest,
with his deacon and cantors, lived chiefly by the cultivation
of the land that was attached to the village church; and in
my youth, in our Central Russia neighbourhood, during the
hot summer months when they were hay-making or taking in
the crops, the priest would always hurry through the mass in
order to return to their field-work. The priest’s house was
in those years a log-house, only a little better built than the
houses of the peasants, alongside which it stood sometimes
thatched, instead of being simply covered with straw, that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
held in position by means of straw ropes. His dress differed
from that of the peasants more by its cut than by the materials
it was made of, and between the church services and
the fulfilment of his parish duties the priest might always be
seen in the fields, following the plough or working in the
meadows with the scythe.</p>

<p>All the children of the clergy receive free education in
special clerical schools, and later on, some of them, in
seminaries; and it was by the description of the abominable
educational methods which prevailed in these schools in
the forties and fifties that <span class="smcap">Pomyalóvskiy</span> (1835-1863)
acquired his notoriety. He was the son of a poor deacon
in a village near St. Petersburg, and had himself passed
through one of these schools and a seminary. Both the lower
and the higher schools were then in the hands of quite uneducated
priests—chiefly monks—and the most absurd learning
by rote of the most abstract theology was the rule. The
general moral tone of the schools was extremely low, drinking
went on to excess, and flogging for every lesson not
recited by heart, sometimes two or three times a day, with
all sorts of refinements of cruelty—was the chief instrument
of education. Pomyalóvskiy passionately loved his
younger brother and wanted at all hazards to save him from
such an experience as his own; so he began to write for a
pedagogical review, on the education given in the clerical
schools, in order to get the means to educate his brother in
a gymnasium. A most powerful novel, evidently taken from
real life in these schools, followed, and numbers of priests,
who had themselves been the victims of a like “education,”
wrote to the papers to confirm what Pomyalóvskiy had said.
Truth, without any decoration, naked truth, with an absolute
negation of art for art’s sake, were the distinctive features
of Pomyalóvskiy, who went so far in this direction as even
to part with the so-called heroes. The men whom he described
were not sharply outlined types, but, if I may be permitted
to express myself in this way, the “neutral-tint” types of
real life: those indefinite, not too good and not too bad
characters of whom mankind is mostly composed, and whose
inertia is everywhere the great obstacle to progress.</p>

<p>Besides his sketches from the life of the clerical schools,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Pomyalóvskiy wrote also two novels from the life of the
poorer middle classes: <i>Philistine Happiness</i>, and <i>Mólotoff</i>—which
is autobiographic to a great extent—and an unfinished
larger novel, <i>Brother and Sister</i>. He displayed in these works
the same broad humanitarian spirit as Dostoyévskiy had for
noticing humane redeeming features in the most degraded
men and women, but with the sound realistic tendency which
made the distinctive feature of the young literary school of
which he was one of the founders. And he depicted also, in
an extraordinarily powerful and tragic manner, the hero
from the poorer classes—who is imbued with hatred towards
the upper classes and toward all forms of social life which
exist for their advantage—and yet has not the faith in his
own possibilities, which knowledge gives, and which a real
force always has. Therefore this hero ends, either in a philistine
family idyll, or, this failing, in a propaganda of reckless
cruelty and of contempt towards all mankind, as the only
possible foundation for personal happiness.</p>

<p>These novels were full of promise, and Pomyalóvskiy was
looked upon as the future leader of a new school of literature;
but he died, even before he had reached the age of
thirty.</p>

<h3>RYESHÉTNIKOFF</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ryeshétnikoff</span> (1841-1871) went still further in the
same direction, and, with Pomyalóvskiy, he may be considered
as the founder of the ultra-realistic school of Russian
folk-novelists. He was born in the Uráls and was the son of
a poor church cantor who became a postman. The family was
in extreme poverty. An uncle took him to the town of Perm,
and there he was beaten and thrashed all through his childhood.
When he was ten years old they sent him to a
miserable clerical school, where he was treated even worse
than at his uncle’s. He ran away, but was caught, and they
flogged the poor child so awfully that he had to lie in a
hospital for two months. As soon as he was taken back to
school he ran away a second time, joining a band of tramping
beggars. He suffered terribly during his peregrinations
with them, and was caught once more, and again flogged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
the most barbarous way. His uncle also was a postman, and
Ryeshétnikoff, having nothing to read, used to steal newspapers
from the Post Office, and after reading them, he destroyed
them. This was, however, discovered, the boy having
destroyed some important Imperial manifesto addressed to
the local authorities. He was brought before a Court and
condemned to be sent to a monastery for a few months (there
were no reformatories then). The monks were kind to him,
but they led a most dissolute life, drinking excessively, over-eating,
and stealing away from the monastery at night, and
they taught the boy to drink. In spite of all this, after his
release from the monastery Ryeshétnikoff passed brilliantly
the examinations in the district school, and was received as
a clerk in the Civil Service, at a salary of six shillings, and
later on, half-a-guinea per month. This meant, of course, the
most wretched poverty, because the young man took no
bribes, as all clerks in those times were accustomed to do.
The arrival of a “revisor” at Perm saved him. This gentleman
employed Ryeshétnikoff as a copyist, and, having come
to like him, gave him the means to move to St. Petersburg,
where he found him a position as clerk in the Ministry of
Finance at almost double his former salary. Ryeshétnikoff
had begun to write already, at Perm, and he continued to do
so at St. Petersburg, sending contributions to some of the
lesser newspapers, until he made the acquaintance of Nekrásoff.
Then he published his novel, <i>Podlípovtsy</i>, in <i>The Contemporary</i>
(<i>Ceux de Podlipnaïa</i>, in a French translation).</p>

<p>Ryeshétnikoff’s position in literature is quite unique. “The
sound truth of Ryeshétnikoff”—in these words Turguéneff
characterised his writings. It is truth, indeed, nothing
but truth, without any attempt at decoration or lyric effects—a
sort of diary in which the men with whom the author
lived in the mining works of the Uráls, in his Permian village,
or in the slums of St. Petersburg, are described. “Podlípovtsy”
means the inhabitants of a small village Podlípnaya,
lost somewhere in the mountains of the Uráls. They are
Permians, not yet quite Russified, and are still in the stage
which so many populations of the Russian Empire are living
through nowadays—namely the early agricultural. Few of
them have for more than two months a year pure rye-bread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
to eat: the remaining ten months they are compelled to
add the bark of trees to their flour in order to have “bread”
at all. They have not the slightest idea of what Russia is,
or of the State, and very seldom do they see a priest. They
hardly know how to cultivate the land. They do not know
how to make a stove, and periodical starvation during the
months from January to July has taken the very soul and
heart out of them. They stand on a lower level than real
savages.</p>

<p>One of their best men, Pilá, knows how to count up
to five, but the others are unable to do so. Pilá’s conceptions
of space and time are of the most primitive description,
and yet this Pilá is a born leader of his semi-savage
village people, and is continually making something for them.
He tells them when it is time to plough; he tries to find a
sale for their small domestic industries; he knows how to
go to the next town, and when there is anything to be done
there, he does it. His relations with his family, which consists
of an only daughter, Apróska, are at a stage belonging to
prehistorical anthropology, and yet he and his friend Sysói
love that girl Apróska so deeply, that after her death they
are ready to kill themselves. They abandon their village to
lead the hard life of boatmen on the river, dragging the
heavy boats up the current. But these semi-savages are deeply
human, and one feels that they are so, not merely because
the author wants it, but in reality; and one cannot read the
story of their lives and the sufferings which they endure, with
the resignation of a patient beast, without being moved at
times even more deeply than by a good novel from our own
life.</p>

<p>Another novel of Ryeshétnikoff, <i>The Glúmoffs</i>, is perhaps
one of the most depressing novels in this branch of literature.
There is nothing striking in it—no misfortunes, no calamities,
no dramatic effects; but the whole life of the ironworkers
of the Uráls, who are described in this novel, is so gloomy,
there is so little possibility of possible escape from this
gloominess, that sheer despair seizes you, as you gradually
realise the immobility of the life which this novel represents.
In <i>Among Men</i> Ryeshétnikoff tells the story of his own
terrible childhood. As to his larger two-volume novel—<i>Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
is it Better?</i>—it is an interminable string of misfortunes
which befell a woman of the poorer classes, who came
to St. Petersburg in search of work. We have here (as well
as in another long novel, <i>One’s Own Bread</i>) the same shapelessness
and the same absence of strongly depicted characters
as in <i>The Glúmoffs</i>, and we receive the same gloomy impression.</p>

<p>The literary defects of all Ryeshétnikoff’s work are only
too evident. Yet in spite of them, he may claim to be considered
as the initiator of a new style of novel, which has its
artistic value, notwithstanding its want of form and the ultra-realism
of both its conception and structure. Ryeshétnikoff
certainly could not inspire a school of imitators; but he has
given hints to those who came after him as to what must be
done to create the true folk-novel, and what must be avoided.
There is not the slightest trace of romanticism in his work; no
heroes; nothing but that great, indifferent, hardly individualised
crowd, among which there are no striking colours, no
giants; all is small; all interests are limited to a microscopically
narrow neighbourhood. In fact, they all centre round
the all-dominating question, Where to get food and shelter,
even at the price of unbearable toil. Every person described
has, of course, his individuality; but all these individualities
are merged into one single desire: that of finding a living
which shall not be sheer misery—shall not consist of days of
well-being alternating with days of starvation. How lessen
the hardships of work which is beyond a man’s forces? how
find a place in the world where work shall not be done amid
such degrading conditions? these questions make the unanimity
of purpose among all these men and women.</p>

<p>There are, I have just said, no heroes in Ryeshétnikoff’s
novels: that means, no “heroes” in our usual literary sense;
but you see before you real Titans—real heroes in the
primitive sense of the word—heroes of endurance—such as
the species must produce when, a shapeless crowd, it bitterly
struggles against frost and hunger. The way in which these
heroes support the most incredible physical privations as
they tramp from one part of Russia to another, or have to
face the most cruel deceptions in their search for work—the
way they struggle for existence—is already striking enough;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
but the way in which they die, is perhaps even more striking.
Many readers remember, of course, Tolstóy’s <i>Three Deaths</i>:
the lady dying from consumption, and cursing her illness; the
peasant who in his last hours thinks of his boots, and directs
to whom they shall be given, so that they may go to the toiler
most in need of them; and the third—the death of the birch
tree. For Ryeshétnikoff’s heroes, who live all their lives without
being sure of bread for the morrow, death is not a catastrophe:
it simply means less and less force to get one’s
food, less and less energy to chew one’s dry piece of bread,
less and less bread, less oil in the lamp—and the lamp is
blown out.</p>

<p>Another most terrible thing in Ryeshétnikoff’s novels is
his picture of how the habit of drunkenness takes possession
of men. You see it coming—see how it must come, organically,
necessarily, fatally—how it takes possession of the
man, and how it holds him till his death. This Shakespearian
fatalism applied to drink—whose workings are only too well
known to those who know popular life—is perhaps the most
terrible feature of Ryeshétnikoff’s novels. Especially is it
apparent in <i>The Glúmoffs</i>, where you see how the teacher in
a mining town, because he refuses to join the administration
in the exploitation of children, is deprived of all means of living
and although he marries in the long run a splendid
woman, sinks at last into the clutches of the demon of habitual
drunkenness. Only the women do not drink, and that saves
the race from utter destruction; in fact, nearly every one of
Ryeshétnikoff’s women is a heroine of persevering labour,
of struggle for the necessities of life, as the female is in the
whole animal world; and such the women are in real popular
life in Russia.</p>

<p>If it is very difficult to avoid romantic sentimentalism,
when the author who describes the monotony of the everyday
life of a middle-class crowd intends to make the reader sympathise
nevertheless with this crowd, the difficulties are still
greater when he descends a step lower in the social scale and
deals with peasants, or, still worse, with those who belong to
the lowest strata of city life. The most realistic writers have
fallen into sentimentalism and romanticism when they
attempted to do this. Even Zola in his last novel, <i>Work</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
falls into the trap. But that is precisely what Ryeshétnikoff
never did. His writings are a violent protest against æsthetics,
and even against all sorts of conventional art. He was a
true child of the epoch characterised by Turguéneff in Bazároff.
“I do not care for the form of my writings: truth
will speak for itself,” he seems to say to his readers. He
would have felt ashamed if, even unconsciously, he had
resorted anywhere to dramatic effects in order to touch
his readers—just as the public speaker who entirely relies
upon the beauty of the thought he develops would feel
ashamed if some merely oratorical expression escaped his lips.</p>

<p>For myself, I think that a great creative genius was
required in order to pick, as Ryeshétnikoff did, out of the
everyday, monotonous life of the crowd, those trifling expressions,
those exclamations, those movements expressive of
some feelings or some idea without which his novels would
have been quite unreadable. It has been remarked by one
of our critics that when you begin to read a novel of Ryeshétnikoff
you seem to have plunged into a chaos. You have
the description of a commonplace landscape, which, in fact,
is no “landscape” at all; then the future hero or heroine of
the novel appears, and he or she is a person whom you may
see in every crowd—with no claims to rise above this crowd,
with hardly anything even to distinguish him or her from the
crowd. This hero speaks, eats, drinks, works, swears, as
everyone else in the crowd does. He is not a chosen creature—he
is not a demoniacal character—a Richard III. in a
fustian jacket; nor is she a Cordelia or even a Dickens’
“Nell.” Ryeshétnikoff’s men and women are exactly like
thousands of men and women around them; but gradually,
owing to those very scraps of thought, to an exclamation,
to a word dropped here and there, or even to a slight movement
that is mentioned—you begin to feel interested in them.
After thirty pages you feel that you are already decidedly in
sympathy with them and you are so captured that you read
pages and pages of these chaotic details with the sole purpose
of solving the question which begins passionately to
interest you: Will Peter or Anna find to-day the piece of
bread which they long to have? Will Mary get the work
which might procure her a pinch of tea for her sick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
half crazy mother? Will the woman Praskóvia freeze during
that bitterly cold night when she is lost in the streets of
St. Petersburg or will she be taken at last to a hospital where
she may have a warm blanket and cup of tea? Will the postman
abstain from the “fire-water,” and will he get a situation,
or not?</p>

<p>Surely, to obtain this result with such unconventional
means reveals a very great talent; it means, to possess that
power of moving one’s readers—of making them love and
hate—which makes the very essence of literary talent; and
this is why those shapeless, and much too long, and much
too dreary novels of Ryeshétnikoff make a landmark in Russian
literature, and are the precursors not only of a Górkiy,
but, most surely, of a greater talent still.</p>

<h3>LEVÍTOFF</h3>

<p>Another folk-novelist of the same generation was <span class="smcap">Levítoff</span>
(1835 or 1842-1877). He described chiefly those
portions of southern Middle Russia which are in the borderland
between the wooded parts of the country and the treeless
prairies. His life was extremely sad. He was born in
the family of a poor country priest in a village of the
province of Tambóf, and was educated in a clerical school of
the type described by Pomyalóvskiy. When he was only sixteen
he went on foot to Moscow, in order to enter the university,
and then moved to St. Petersburg. There he was soon
involved in some “students’ affair,” and was exiled, in
1858, to Shenkúrsk, in the far north, and next removed to
Vólogda. Here he lived in complete isolation from everything
intellectual, and in awful poverty verging on starvation.
Not until three years later was he allowed to return to
Moscow, and, being absolutely penniless, he made all the
journey from Vólogda to Moscow on foot, earning occasionally
a few shillings by clerical work done for the cantonal
Board of some village. These years of exile left a deep trace
upon all his subsequent life, which he passed in extreme
poverty, never finding a place where he could settle, and
drowning in drink the sufferings of a loving, restless soul.</p>

<p>During his early childhood he was deeply impressed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
the charm and quiet of village life in the prairies, and he
wrote later on: “This quietness of village life passes before
me, or rather flies, as something really living, as a well defined
image. Yes, I distinctly see above our daily life in the village,
somebody gliding—a little above the cross of our church,
together with the light clouds—somebody light and soft of
outline, having the mild and modest face of our prairie girls.
... Thus, after many years spent amidst the untold
sufferings of my present existence, do I represent to myself
the genius of country life.”</p>

<p>The charm of the boundless prairies of South Russia—the
Steppes—is so admirably rendered by Levítoff that no Russian
author has surpassed him in the poetical description
of their nature, excepting Koltsóff in his poetry. Levítoff
was a pure flower of the Steppes, full of the most poetical
love of his birthplace, and he certainly must have suffered
deeply when he was thrown amidst the intellectual proletarians
in the great, cold, and egotistic capital of the Nevá.
Whenever he stayed at St. Petersburg or at Moscow he
always lived in the poorest quarters, somewhere on the outskirts
of the town: they reminded him of his native village;
and when he thus settled amongst the lowest strata of the
population, he did so, as he wrote himself, “to run away
from the moral contradictions, the artificiality of life, the
would-be humanitarianism, and the cut and dried imaginary
superiority of the educated classes.” He could not live, for
even a couple of months in succession, in relative well-being:
he began to feel the gnawings of conscience, and it ended in
his leaving behind his extremely poor belongings and going
somewhere—anywhere where he would be poorer still,
amidst other poor who live from hand to mouth.</p>

<p>I do not even know if I am right in describing Levítoff’s
works as novels. They are more like shapeless, lyrical-epical
improvisations in prose. Only in these improvisations we have
not the usual hackneyed presentment of the writer’s compassion
for other people’s sufferings. It is an epical description
of what the author has lived through in his close contact
with all classes of people of the poorest sort, and its lyric
element is the sorrow that he himself knew—not in imagination—as
he lived that same life; the sorrow of want, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
family troubles, of hopes unsatisfied, of isolation, of all sorts
of oppression, and of all sorts of human weakness. The pages
which he has given to the feelings of the drunken man and
to the ways in which this disease—drunkenness—takes possession
of men, are something really terrible. Of course, he
died young—from an inflammation of the lungs caught one
day in January, as he went in an old summer coat to get
ten shillings from some petty editor at the other end of
Moscow.</p>

<p>The best known work of Levítoff is a volume of <i>Sketches
from the Steppes</i>; but he has also written scenes from the
life of the towns, under the title of <i>Moscow Dens and Slums</i>,
<i>Street Sketches</i>, etc., and a volume to which some of his
friends must have given the title of <i>Sorrows of the Villages,
the High Roads, and the Towns</i>. In the second of these
works we find a simply terrifying collection of tramps and
outcasts of the large cities—of men sunk to the lowest level
of city slum-life, represented without the slightest attempt at
idealising them—and yet deeply human. <i>Sketches from the
Steppes</i> remains his best work. It is a collection of poems,
written in prose, full of the most admirable descriptions of
prairie nature and of tiny details from the life of the peasants,
with all their petty troubles, their habits, customs, and superstitions.
Plenty of personal reminiscences are scattered
through these sketches, and one often finds in them a scene of
children playing in the meadows of the prairies and living
in accordance with the life of nature, in which every little
trait is pictured with a warm, tender love; and almost everywhere
one feels the unseen tears of sorrow, shed by the
author.</p>

<p>Amongst the several sketches of the life and work of
Levítoff there is one—written with deep feeling and containing
charming idyllic features from his childhood as well
as a terrible account of his later years—by A. Skabitchévskiy,
in his <i>History of Modern Russian Literature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<h3>GLEB USPÉNSKIY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Gleb Uspénskiy</span> (1840-1902) widely differs from all
the preceding writers. He represents a school in himself, and
I know of no writer in any literature with whom he might be
compared. Properly speaking, he is not a novelist; but his
work is not ethnography or demography either, because it
contains, besides descriptions belonging to the domain of
folk-psychology, all the elements of a novel. His first productions
were novels with a leaning towards ethnography. Thus,
<i>Ruin</i> is a novel in which Uspénskiy admirably described how
all the life of a small provincial town, which had flourished
under the habits and manners of serfdom, went to ruin after
the abolition of that institution: but his later productions,
entirely given to village life, and representing the full maturity
of his talent, had more the character of ethnographic
sketches, written by a gifted novelist, than of novels proper.
They began like novels. Different persons appear before you
in the usual way, and gradually you grow interested in their
doings and their life. Moreover, they are not offered you
haphazard, as they would be in the diary of an ethnographer;
they have been chosen by the author because he considers
them typical of those aspects of village life which he intends
to deal with. However, the author is not satisfied with merely
acquainting the reader with these types: he soon begins to
discuss them and to talk about their position in village life
and the influence they must exercise upon the future of the
village; and, being already interested in the people, you read
the discussions with interest. Then some admirable scene,
which would not be out of place in a novel of Tolstóy or Turguéneff,
is introduced; but after a few pages of such artistic
creation Uspénskiy becomes again an ethnographer discussing
the future of the village-community. He was too much
of a political writer to always think in images and to be a
pure novelist, but he was also too passionately impressed by
the individual facts which came under his observation to
calmly discuss them, as the merely political writer would do.
In spite of all this, notwithstanding this mixture of political
literature with art, because of his artistic gifts, you read
Uspénskiy just as you read a good novelist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>Every movement among the educated classes in favour of
the poorer classes begins by an idealisation of the latter. It
being necessary to clear away, first of all, a number of prejudices
which exist among the rich as regards the poor, some
idealisation is unavoidable. Therefore, the earlier folk-novelist
takes only the most striking types—those whom the
wealthier people can better understand and sympathise with;
and he lightly passes over the less sympathetic features of the
life of the poor. This was done in the forties in France and
England, and in Russia by Grigoróvitch, Márko Vovtchók,
and several others. Then came Ryeshétnikoff with his artistic
Nihilism: with his negation of all the usual tricks of art, and
his objectivism; his blunt refusal to create “types” and his
preference for the quite ordinary man; his manner of transmitting
to you his love of his people, merely through the suppressed
intensity of his own emotion. Later on, new problems
arose for Russian literature. The readers were now quite
ready to sympathise with the individual peasant or factory
worker; but they wanted to know something more: namely,
what were the very foundations, the ideals, the springs of
village life? what were they worth in the further development
of the nation? what, and in what form, could the immense
agricultural population of Russia contribute to the further
development of the country and the civilised world
altogether? All such questions could not be answered by the
statistician alone; they required the genius of the artist, who
must decipher the reply out of the thousands of small indications
and facts, and our folk-novelists understood this new
demand of the reader. A rich collection of individual peasant
types having already been given, it was now the life of the
village—the <i>mir</i>, with its advantages and drawbacks, and its
promises for the future—that the readers were anxious to
find in the folk-novel. These were the questions which the
new generation of folk-novelists undertook to discuss.</p>

<p>In this venture they were certainly right. It must not be
forgotten that in the last analysis every economical and
social question is a question of psychology of both the individual
and the social aggregation. It cannot be solved
by arithmetic alone. Therefore, in social science, as in
human psychology, the poet often sees his way better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
the physiologist. At any rate, he too has his voice in the
matter.</p>

<p>When Uspénskiy began writing his first sketches of village
life—it was in the early seventies—Young Russia was in the
grip of the great movement “towards the people,” and it
must be owned that in this movement, as in every other, there
was some idealisation. Those who did not know village-life at
all cherished exaggerated, idyllic illusions about the village-community.
In all probability Uspénskiy, who was born in a
large industrial town, Túla, in the family of a small functionary
and hardly knew country life at all, shared these illusions
to some extent, very probably in their most extreme aspect;
and still preserving them he went to a province of southeastern
Russia, Samára, which had lately become the prey of
modern commercialism, and where, owing to a number of
peculiar circumstances, the abolition of serfdom had been accomplished
under conditions specially ruinous to the peasants
and to village-life altogether. Here he must have suffered
intensely from seeing his youthful dreams vanishing; and, as
artists often do, he hastened to generalise; but he had not the
education of the thorough ethnographer, which might have
prevented him from making too hasty ethnological generalisations
from his limited materials, and he began to write a
series of scenes from village-life, imbued with a deep pessimism.
It was only much later on, while staying in a village of
Northern Russia, in the province of Nóvgorod, that he came
to understand the influences which the culture of the land
and life in an agricultural village may exercise upon the tiller
of the soil; then only had he some glimpses of what are the
social and moral forces of land cultivation and communal
life, and of what free labour on a free soil might be. These
observations inspired Uspénskiy with perhaps the best thing
he wrote, <i>The Power of the Soil</i> (1882). It will remain, at
any rate, his most important contribution in this domain—the
artist appearing here in all the force of his talent and in
his true function of explaining the inner springs of a certain
mood of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<h3>ZLATOVRÁTSKIY AND OTHER FOLK-NOVELISTS</h3>

<p>One of the great questions of the day for Russia is,
whether we shall abolish the communal ownership of the
land, as it has been abolished in Western Europe, and introduce
instead of it individual peasant proprietorship; or
whether we shall endeavour to retain the village community,
and do our best to develop it further in the direction of coöperative
associations, both agricultural and industrial. A
great struggle goes on accordingly among the educated classes
of Russia upon this question, and in his first Samára sketches,
entitled <i>From a Village Diary</i>, Uspénskiy paid a great deal
of attention to this subject. He tried to prove that the village
community, such as it is, results in a formidable oppression
of the individual, in a hampering of individual initiative, in
all sorts of oppression of the poorer peasants by the richer
ones, and, consequently, in general poverty. He omitted, however,
all the arguments which these same poorer peasants,
if they should be questioned, would bring forward in favour
of the present communal ownership of the land; and he
attributed to this institution what is the result of other general
causes, as may be seen from the fact that exactly the same
poverty, the same inertia, and the same oppression of the
individual, are found in an even greater degree in Little
Russia, where the village community has ceased to exist long
since. Uspénskiy thus expressed—at least in those sketches
which dealt with the villages of Samára—the views which
prevail among the middle classes of Western Europe, and
are current in Russia among the growing village <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>This attitude called forth a series of replies from another
folk-novelist of an equally great talent, <span class="smcap">Zlatovrátskiy</span>
(born 1845), who answered each sketch of Uspénskiy’s by
a novel in which he took the extreme opposite view. He had
known peasant life in Middle Russia from his childhood;
and the less illusions he had about it, the better was he able,
when he began a serious study of the peasants, to see the good
features of their lives, and to understand those types of them
who take to heart the interests of the village as a whole—types
that I also well knew in my youth in the same provinces.</p>

<p>Zlatovrátskiy was accused, of course, of idealising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
peasants; but the reality is, that Uspénskiy and Zlatovrátskiy
complement each other. Just as they complement each other
geographically—the latter speaking for the truly agricultural
region of Middle Russia, while Uspénskiy spoke for the
periphery of this region—so also they complement each other
psychologically. Uspénskiy was right in showing the drawbacks
of the village community institution—deprived of its
vitality by an omnipotent bureaucracy; and Zlatovrátskiy
was quite right, too, in showing what sort of men are nevertheless
bred by the village-communal institutions and by
attachment to the land, and what services they could render
to the rural masses under different conditions of liberty and
independence.</p>

<p>Zlatovrátskiy’s novels are thus an important ethnographical
contribution, and they have at the same time an artistic
value. His <i>Everyday Life in the Village</i>, and perhaps even
more his <i>Peasant Jurymen</i> (since 1864, the peasant heads of
households have acted in turn as jurors in the law courts),
are full of the most charming scenes of village-life; while his
<i>Foundations</i> represents a serious attempt at grasping in a
work of art the fundamental conceptions of Russian rural
life. In this last work we also find types of men, who personify
the revolt of the peasant against both external oppression
and the submissiveness of the mass to that oppression—men,
who, under favourable conditions might become the
initiators of movements of a deep purport. That types have
not been invented will be agreed by everyone who knows
Russian village-life from the inside.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The writers who have been named in the preceding pages
are far from representing the whole school of folk-novelists.
Not only has every Russian novelist of the past, from Turguéneff
down, been inspired in some of his work by folk life,
but some of the best productions of the most prominent contemporary
writers, such as Korolénko, Tchéhoff, Oertel and
many others (see next chapter), belong to the same category.
There are besides quite a number of novelists distinctively
of this class, who would be spoken of at some length
in any course of Russian literature, but whom, unfortunately,
I am compelled to mention in but a few lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Naúmoff</span> was born at Tobólsk (in 1838) and, settling
in Western Siberia after he had received a university education
at St. Petersburg, he wrote a series of short novels and
sketches in which he described life in West Siberian villages
and mining towns. These stories were widely read, owing to
their expressive, truly popular language, the energy with
which they were imbued, and the striking pictures they contained
of the advantage taken of the poverty of the mass by
the richer peasants, known in Russia as “<i>mir</i>-eaters”
(<i>miroyéd</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zasódimskiy</span> (born 1843) belongs to the same period.
Like many of his contemporaries, he spent years of his youth
in exile, but he remains still the same “populist” that he
was in his youth, imbued with the same love of the people and
the same faith in the peasants. His <i>Chronicle of the Village
Smúrino</i> (1874) and <i>Mysteries of the Steppes</i> (1882) are
especially interesting, because Zasódimskiy made in these
novels attempts at representing types of intellectual and protesting
peasants, true to life, but usually neglected by our
folk-novelists. Some of them are rebels who revolt against
the conditions of village-life, chiefly in their own, personal
interest, while others are peaceful religious propagandists,
and still others are men who have developed under the influence
of educated propagandists.</p>

<p>Another writer who excelled in the representation of the
type of “<i>mir</i>-eaters” in the villages of European Russia is
<span class="smcap">Sáloff</span> (1843-1902).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petropávlovskiy</span> (1857-1892), who wrote under the
pseudonym of <span class="smcap">Karónin</span>, was, on the other hand, a real poet
of village-life and of the cultivation of the fields. He was
born in southeastern Russia, in the province of Samára, but
was early exiled to the government of Tobólsk, in Siberia,
where he was kept many years, and from which he was
released only to die soon after from consumption. He gave
in his novels and stories several very dramatic types of
village “ne’er-do-well’s,” but the novel which is most typical
of his talent is <i>My World</i>. In it he tells how an “intellectual,”
“rent in twain” and nearly losing his reason in
consequence of this dualism, finds inner peace and reconciliation
with life when he settles in a village and works in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
the same almost superhuman way that the peasants do, when
hay has to be mown and the crops to be carried in. Thus
living the life they live, he is loved by them, and finds a
healthy and intelligent girl to love him. This is, of course,
to some extent an idyll of village life; but so slight is the
idealisation, as we know from the experience of those “intellectuals”
who went to the villages as equals coming among
equals, that the idyll reads almost as a reality.</p>

<p>Several more folk-novelists ought to be mentioned. Such
are <span class="smcap">L. Melshin</span> (born 1860), the pseudonym of an exile
“<span class="smcap">P. Ya.</span>,” who is also a poet, and who, having been kept
for twelve years at hard labour in Siberia as a political convict,
has published two volumes of hard-labour sketches, <i>In
the World of the Outcasts</i> (a work to put by the side of
Dostoyévskiy’s <i>Dead House</i>); <span class="smcap">S. Elpátievskiy</span> (born
1854), also an exile, who has given good sketches of Siberian
tramps; <span class="smcap">Nefédoff</span> (1847-1902), an ethnographer who has
made valuable scientific researches and at the same time has
published excellent sketches of factory and village life, and
whose writings are thoroughly imbued with a deep faith
in the store of energy and plastic creative power of the
masses of the country people; and several others. Every one
of these writers deserves, however, more than a short notice,
because each has contributed something, either to the comprehension
of this or that class of the people, or to the working
out of those forms of “idealistic realism” which are
best suited for dealing with types taken from the toiling
masses, and which has lately made the literary success of
Maxím Górkiy.</p>

<h3>MAXÍM GÓRKIY</h3>

<p>Few writers have established their reputation so rapidly as
<span class="smcap">Maxím Górkiy</span>. His first sketches (1892-95) were published
in an obscure provincial paper of the Caucasus, and
were totally unknown to the literary world, but when a short
tale of his appeared in a widely-read review, edited by Korolénko,
it at once attracted general attention. The beauty of
its form, its artistic finish, and the new note of strength and
courage which rang through it, brought the young writer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
immediately into prominence. It became known that “Maxím
Górkiy” was the pseudonym of a quiet young man, <span class="smcap">A.
Pyéshkoff</span>, who was born in 1868 in Níjniy Nóvgorod, a
large town on the Vólga; that his father was a merchant or an
artisan, his mother a remarkable peasant woman, who died
soon after the birth of her son, and that the boy, orphaned
when only nine, was brought up in a family of his father’s
relatives. The childhood of “Górkiy” must have been anything
but happy, for one day he ran away and entered into
service on a Vólga river steamer. This took place when he
was only twelve. Later on he worked as a baker, became a
street porter, sold apples in a street, till at last he obtained
the position of clerk at a lawyer’s. In 1891 he lived and
wandered on foot with the tramps in South Russia, and during
these wanderings he wrote a number of short stories, of which
the first was published in 1892, in a newspaper of Northern
Caucasia. The stories proved to be remarkably fine, and when
a collection of all that he had hitherto written was published
in 1900, in four small volumes, the whole of a large edition
was sold in a very short time, and the name of Górkiy took
its place—to speak of living novelists only—by the side of
those of Korolénko and Tchéhoff, immediately after the name
of Leo Tolstóy. In Western Europe and America his reputation
was made with the same rapidity as soon as a couple of
his sketches were translated into French and German, and

<p>It is sufficient to read a few of Górkiy’s short stories, for
instance, <i>Málva</i>, or <i>Tchelkásh</i>, or <i>The Ex-Men</i>, or <i>Twenty-Six
Men and One Girl</i>, to realise at once the causes of his
rapidly won popularity. The men and women he describes
are not heroes: they are the most ordinary tramps or slum-dwellers;
and what he writes are not novels in the proper
sense of the word, but merely sketches of life. And yet, in the
literature of all nations, including the short stories of Guy
de Maupassant and Bret Harte, there are few things in
which such a fine analysis of complicated and struggling
human feelings is given, such interesting, original, and new
characters are so well depicted, and human psychology is
so admirably interwoven with a background of nature—a
calm sea, menacing waves, or endless, sunburnt prairies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
In the first-named story you really <i>see</i> the promontory that
juts out into “the laughing waters,” that promontory upon
which the fisherman has pitched his hut; and you understand
why Málva, the woman who loves him and comes to see
him every Sunday, loves that spot as much as she does the
fisherman himself. And then at every page you are struck
by the quite unexpected variety of fine touches with which
the love of that strange and complicated nature, Málva, is
depicted, or by the unforeseen aspects under which both the
ex-peasant fisherman and his peasant-son appear in the short
space of a few days. The variety of strokes, refined and
brutal, tender and terribly harsh, with which Górkiy pictures
human feelings is such that in comparison with his heroes
the heroes and heroines of our best novelists seem so simple—so
simplified—just like a flower in European decorative art
in comparison with a real flower.</p>

<p>Górkiy is a great artist; he is a poet; but he is also a
child of all that long series of folk-novelists whom Russia
has had for the last half century, and he has utilised their
experience: he has found at last that happy combination of
realism with idealism for which the Russian folk-novelists
have been striving for so many years. Ryeshétnikoff and his
school had tried to write novels of an ultra-realistic character
without any trace of idealisation. They restrained themselves
whenever they felt inclined to generalise, to create, to
idealise. They tried to write mere diaries, in which events,
great and small, important and insignificant, were related with
an equal exactitude, without even changing the tone of the
narrative. We have seen that in this way, by dint of their
talent, they were able to obtain the most poignant effects;
but like the historian who vainly tries to be “impartial,”
yet always remains a party man, they had not avoided the
idealisation which they so much dreaded. They could not
avoid it. A work of art is always personal; do what he may,
the author’s sympathies will necessarily appear in his creation,
and he will always idealise those who answer to them.
Grigórovitch and Márko Vovtchók had idealised the all-pardoning
patience and the all-enduring submissiveness of
the Russian peasant; and Ryeshétnikoff had quite unconsciously,
and maybe against his will, idealised the almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
supernatural powers of endurance which he had seen in the
Uráls and in the slums of St. Petersburg. Both had idealised
something: the ultra-realist as well as the romantic. Górkiy
must have understood the significance of this; at all events
he does not object in the least to a certain idealisation. In his
adherence to truth he is as much of a realist as Ryeshétnikoff;
but he idealises in the same sense as Turguéneff did
when he pictured Rúdin, Helen, or Bazároff. He even says
that we <i>must</i> idealise, and he chooses for idealisation the type
he admired most among those tramps whom he knew—the
rebel. This made his success; it appeared to be exactly what
the readers of all nations were unconsciously calling for as
a relief from the dull mediocrity and absence of strong individuality
all about them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The stratum of society from which Górkiy took the heroes
of his first short stories—and in short stories he appears at
his best—is that of the tramps of Southern Russia: men who
have broken with regular society, who never accept the yoke
of permanent work, labouring only as long as they want to,
as “casuals” in the sea-ports on the Black Sea; who sleep
in doss-houses or in ravines on the outskirts of the cities, and
tramp in the summer from Odessa to the Crimea, and from
the Crimea to the prairies of Northern Caucasia, where they
are always welcome at harvest time.</p>

<p>That eternal complaint about poverty and bad luck, that
helplessness and hopelessness which were the dominant notes
with the early folk-novelists, are totally absent from Górkiy’s
stories. His tramps do not complain. “Everything is all
right,” one of them says; “no use to whine and complain—that
would do no good. Live and endure till you are broken
down, or if you are so already—wait for death. This is all
the wisdom in the world—do you understand?”</p>

<p>Far from his whining and complaining about the hard lot
of his tramps, a refreshing note of energy and courage, which
is quite unique in Russian literature, sounds through the
stories of Górkiy. His tramps are miserably poor, but they
“don’t care.” They drink, but there is nothing among them
nearly approaching the dark drunkenness of despair which we
saw in Levítoff. Even the most “down-trodden” one of them—far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
from making a virtue of his helplessness, as Dostoyévskiy’s
heroes always did—dreams of reforming the world
and making it rich. He dreams of the moment when “we,
once ‘the poor,’ shall vanish, after having enriched the
Crœsuses with the richness of the spirit and the power of
life.” (<i>A Mistake</i>, I, 170.)</p>

<p>Górkiy cannot stand whining; he cannot bear that self-castigation
in which other Russian writers so much delight:
which Turguéneff’s sub-Hamlets used to express so poetically,
of which Dostoyévskiy has made a virtue, and of
which Russia offers such an infinite variety of examples.
Górkiy knows the type, but he has no pity for such men.
Better anything than one of those egotistic weaklings who
gnaw all the time at their own hearts, compel others to drink
with them in order to perorate before them about their
“burning souls”; those beings, “full of compassion” which,
however, never goes beyond self-commiseration, and “full
of love” which is never anything but self-love. Górkiy knows
only too well these men who never fail to wantonly ruin the
lives of those women who trust them; who do not even stop
at murder, like Raskólnikoff, or the brothers Karamázoff,
and yet whine about the circumstances which have brought
them to it. “What’s all this talk about circumstances!” he
makes Old Izerghil say. “Everyone makes his own
circumstances! I see all sorts of men—but the strong ones—where
are they? There are fewer and fewer noble men!”</p>

<p>Knowing how much the Russian “intellectuals” suffer
from this disease of whining, knowing how rare among them
are the aggressive idealists, the real <i>rebels</i>, and how numerous
on the other hand are the Nezhdánoffs (Turguéneff’s
<i>Virgin Soil</i>), even among those “politicals” who march
with resignation to Siberia, Górkiy does not take his types
from among “the intellectuals,” for he thinks that they too
easily become “the prisoners of life.”</p>

<p>In <i>Váreñka Olésova</i> Górkiy expresses all his contempt for
the average “intellectual” of our own days. He introduces
to us the interesting type of a girl, full of vitality; a most
primitive creature, absolutely untouched by any ideals of
liberty and equality, but so full of an intense life, so independent,
so much herself, that one cannot but feel greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
interested in her. She meets with one of those “intellectuals”
who know and admire higher ideals, but are weaklings,
utterly devoid of the nerve of life. Of course, Váreñka laughs
at the very idea of such a man’s falling in love with her; and
these are the expressions in which Górkiy makes her define
the usual hero of Russian novels:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Russian hero is always silly and stupid,” she says; “he is
always sick of something; always thinking about something that cannot
be understood, and is himself so miserable, so mi-i-serable! He will
think, think, then talk, then he will go and make a declaration of love,
and after that he thinks, and thinks again, till he marries....
And when he is married, he talks all sorts of nonsense to his wife,
and then abandons her.” (<i>Váreñka Olésova</i>, II, 281.)</p>
</div>

<p>Górkiy’s favourite type is the “rebel”—the man in full
revolt against Society, but at the same time a strong man, a
power; and as he has found among the tramps with whom
he has lived at least the embryo of this type, it is from this
stratum of society that he takes his most interesting heroes.</p>

<p>In <i>Konováloff</i> Górkiy himself gives the psychology, or,
rather, a partial psychology, of his tramp hero:—“An
‘intellectual’ amongst those whom fate has ill-used—amongst
the ragged, the hungry and embittered half-men
and half-beasts with whom the city slums teem.”—“Usually
a being that can be included in no order,” the man who has
“been torn from all his moorings, who is hostile to everything
and ready to turn upon anything the force of his angry,
embittered scepticism” (II, 23). His tramp feels that he
has been defeated in life, but he does not seek excuse in
circumstances. Konováloff, for instance, will not admit the
theory which is in such vogue among the educated ne’er-do-well,
namely, that he is the sad product of adverse conditions.
“One must be faint-hearted indeed,” he says, “to
become such a man.” “I live, and something goads me
on” ... but “I have no inner line to follow ... do you
understand me? I don’t know how to say it. I have not that
spark in my soul, ... force, perhaps? Something is missing;
that’s all!” And when his young friend who has read in
books all sorts of excuses for weakness of character mentions
“the dark hostile forces round you,” Konováloff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
retorts: “Then make a stand! take a stronger footing!
find your ground, and make a stand!”</p>

<p>Some of Górkiy’s tramps are, of course, philosophers.
They think about human life, and have had opportunities
to know what it is. “Everyone,” he remarks somewhere,
“who has had a struggle to sustain in his life, and has been
defeated by life, and now feels cruelly imprisoned amidst
its squalor, is more of a philosopher than Schopenhauer himself;
for abstract thought can never be cast into such a
correct and vivid plastic form as that in which is expressed
the thought born directly out of suffering.” (I, p. 31.) “The
knowledge of life among such men is striking,” he says
again.</p>

<p>Love of nature is, of course, another characteristic feature
of the tramp—“Konováloff loved nature with a deep,
inarticulate love, which was betrayed only by a glitter in
his eyes. Every time he was in the fields, or on the river
bank, he became permeated with a sort of peace and love
which made him still more like a child. Sometimes he would
exclaim looking at the sky: ‘Good!’ and in this exclamation
there was more sense and feeling than in the rhetoric
of many poets.... Like all the rest, poetry loses its holy
simplicity and spontaneity when it becomes a profession.”
(I, 33-4.)</p>

<p>However, Górkiy’s rebel-tramp is not a Nitzscheite who
ignores everything beyond his narrow egotism, or imagines
himself a “man”; the “diseased ambition” of “an intellectual”
is required to create the true Nitzscheite type. In
Górkiy’s tramps, as in his women of the lowest class, there
are flashes of greatness of character and a simplicity which
is incompatible with the super-man’s self-conceit. He does
not idealise them so as to make of them real heroes; that
would be too untrue to life: the tramp is still a defeated
being. But he shows how among these men, owing to an
inner consciousness of strength, there are moments of greatness,
even though that inner force be not strong enough to
make out of Orlóff (in <i>The Orlóffs</i>) or Iliyá (in <i>The Three</i>)
a real power, a real hero—the man who fights against those
much stronger than himself. He seems to say: Why are not
you, intellectuals, as truly “individual,” as frankly rebellious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
against the Society you criticise, and as strong as some of
these submerged ones are?</p>

<p>In his short stories Górkiy is great; but like his two
contemporaries, Korolénko and Tchéhoff, whenever he has
tried to write a longer novel, with a full development of
characters, he has not succeeded. Taken as a whole, <i>Fomá
Gordéeff</i>, notwithstanding several beautiful and deeply impressive
scenes, is weaker than most of Górkiy’s short stories;
and while the first portion of <i>The Three</i>—the idyllic life of
the three young people, and the tragical issues foreshadowed
in it—makes us expect to find in this novel one of the finest
productions in Russian literature—its end is disappointing.
The French translator of <i>The Three</i> has even preferred to
terminate it abruptly, at the point where Iliyá stands on the
grave of the man whom he has killed, rather than to give
Górkiy’s end of the novel.</p>

<p>Why Górkiy should fail in this direction is, of course, too
delicate and too difficult a question to answer. One cause,
however, may be suggested. Górkiy, like Tolstóy, is too
honest an artist to “invent” an end which the real lives of
his heroes do not suggest to him, although that end might
have been very picturesque; and the class of men whom he
so admirably depicts is not possessed of that consistency and
that “oneness” which are necessary to render a work of
art perfect and to give it that final accord without which it
is never complete.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, Orlóff in <i>The Orlóffs</i>. “My soul burns
within me,” he says. “I want space, to give full swing to
my strength. I feel within me an indomitable force! If the
cholera, let us say, could become a man, a giant—were it Iliyá
Múromets himself—I would meet it! ‘Let it be a struggle
to the death,’ I would say; ‘you are a force, and I, Gríshka
Orlóff, am a force, too: let us see which is the better!’”</p>

<p>But that power, that force does not last. Orlóff says somewhere
that “he is torn in all directions at once,” and that
his fate is to be—not a fighter of giants, but merely a tramp.
And so he ends. Górkiy is too great an artist to make of him
a giant-killer. It is the same with Iliyá in <i>The Three</i>. This
is a powerful type, and one feels inclined to ask, Why did not
Górkiy make him begin a new life under the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
those young propagandists of socialism whom he meets?
Why should he not die, let us say, in one of those encounters
between workingmen on strike and soldiers which took place
in Russia precisely at the time Górkiy was finishing this
novel? But here, too, Górkiy’s reply probably would be that
such things do not happen in real life. Men, like Iliyá, who
dream only of the “clean life of a merchant,” do not join
in labour movements. And he preferred to give a very disappointing
end to his hero—to make him appear miserable
and small in his attack upon the wife of the police-officer, so
as to turn the reader’s sympathies towards even this woman—rather
than to make of Iliyá a prominent figure in a strike-conflict.
If it had been possible to idealise Iliyá so much,
without over-straining the permissible limits of idealisation,
Górkiy probably would have done it, because he is entirely
in favour of idealisation in realistic art; but this would have
been pure romanticism.</p>

<p>Over and over again he returns to the idea of the necessity
of an ideal in the work of the novel-writer. “The cause of
the present opinion (in Russian Society) is,” he says, “the
neglect of idealism. Those who have exiled from life all
romanticism have stripped us so as to leave us quite naked:
this is why we are so uninteresting to one another, and so
disgusted with one another.” (<i>A Mistake</i>, I. 151.) And in
<i>The Reader</i> (1898), he develops his æsthetic canons in full.
He tells how one of his earliest productions, on its appearance
in print, is read one night before a circle of friends. He
receives many compliments for it, and after leaving the
house is tramping along a deserted street, feeling for the
first time in his existence the happiness of life, when a person
unknown to him, and whom he had not noticed among those
present at the reading, overtakes him, and begins to talk
about the duties of the author.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will agree with me,” the stranger says, “that the duty of
literature is to aid man in understanding himself, to raise his faith in
himself, to develop his longing for truth; to combat what is bad in
men; to find what is good in them, and to wake up in their souls
shame, anger, courage, to do everything, in short, to render men
strong in a noble sense of the word, and capable of inspiring their
lives with the holy spirit of beauty.” (III, 271.) “It seems to me, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
need once more to have dreams, pretty creations of our fancy and
visions, because the life we have built up is poor in colour, is dim and
dull.... Well, let us try, perhaps imagination will help man
to rise for a moment above the earth and find his true place on it,
which he has lost.” (245.)</p>
</div>

<p>But further on Górkiy makes a confession which explains
perhaps why he has not yet succeeded in creating a longer
character-novel: “I discovered in myself,” he says, “many
good feelings and desires—a fair proportion of what is
usually called good; but <i>a feeling which could unify all this</i>—a
well-founded, clear thought, embracing all the phenomena
of life—I did not find in myself.” And on reading this, one
at once thinks of Turguéneff, who saw in such a “freedom,”
in such a unified comprehension of the universe and its life,
the first condition for being a great artist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Can you,” the <i>Reader</i> goes on to ask, “create for men ever so
small an illusion that has the power to raise them? No!” “All of
you teachers of the day take more than you give, because you speak
only about faults—you see only those. But there must also be good
qualities in men: you possess some, don’t you?... Don’t you
notice that owing to your continual efforts to define and to classify
them, the virtues and the vices have been entangled like two balls of
black and white thread which have become grey by taking colour from
each other?”... “I doubt whether God has sent you on earth.
If he had sent messengers, he would have chosen stronger men than
you are. He would have lighted in them the fire of a passionate love
of life, of truth, of men.”</p>

<p>“Nothing but everyday life, everyday life, only everyday people,
everyday thoughts and events!” the same pitiless <i>Reader</i> continues.
“When will you, then, speak of ‘the rebel spirit,’ of the necessity of
a new birth of the spirit? Where is, then, the calling to the creation
of a new life? where the lessons of courage? where the words which
would give wings to the soul?”</p>

<p>“Confess you don’t know how to represent life, so that your pictures
of it shall provoke in a man a redemptive spirit of shame and a
burning desire of creating new forms of life.... Can you
accelerate the pulsation of life? Can you inspire it with energy, as
others have done?”</p>

<p>“I see many intelligent men round about me, but few noble ones
among them, and these few are broken and suffering souls. I don’t
know why it should be so, but so it is: the better the man, the cleaner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
and the more honest his soul, the less energy he has; the more he
suffers and the harder is his life.... But although they suffer
so much from feeling the want of something better, they have not the
force to create it.”</p>

<p>“One thing more”—said after an interval my strange interlocutor.
“Can you awake in man a laughter full of the joy of life and at the
same time elevating to the soul? Look, men have quite forgotten good
wholesome laughter!”</p>

<p>“The sense of life is not in self-satisfaction; after all, man is
better than that. The sense of life is in the beauty and the force of
striving towards some aim; every moment of being ought to have
its higher aim.” “Wrath, hatred, shame, loathing, and finally a grim
despair—these are the levers by means of which you may destroy
everything on earth.” “What can you do to awake a thirst for life
when you only whine, sigh, moan, or coolly point out to man that he
is nothing but dust?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for a man, firm and loving, with a burning heart and a
powerful all-embracing mind. In the stuffy atmosphere of shameful
silence, his prophetic words would resound like an alarm-bell, and
perhaps the mean souls of the living dead would shiver!” (253.)</p>
</div>

<p>These ideas of Górkiy about the necessity of something
better than everyday life—something that shall elevate the
soul, fully explain also his last drama, <i>At the Bottom</i>, which
has had such a success at Moscow, but played by the very same
artists at St. Petersburg met with but little enthusiasm. The
idea is the same as that of Ibsen’s <i>Wild Duck</i>. The inhabitants
of a doss-house, all of them, maintain their life-power
only as long as they cherish some illusion: the drunkard
actor dreams of recovery in some special retreat; a fallen
girl takes refuge in her illusion of real love, and so on. And
the dramatic situation of these beings with already so little
to retain them in life, is only the more poignant when the
illusions are destroyed. The drama is powerful. It must lose,
though, on the stage on account of some technical mistakes
(a useless fourth act, the unnecessary person of a woman
introduced in the first scene and then disappearing); but apart
from these mistakes it is eminently dramatic. The positions
are really tragical, the action is rapid, and as to the conversations
of the inhabitants of the doss-house and their
philosophy of life, both are above all praise. Altogether one
feels that Górkiy is very far yet from having said his last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
word. The question is only whether in the classes of society
he now frequents he will be able to discover the further
developments—undoubtedly existing—of the types which
he understands best. Will he find among them further
materials responding to the æsthetic canons whose following
has hitherto been the source of his power?</p>

<h3>POLITICAL LITERATURE</h3>

<p>To speak of political literature in a country which
has no political liberty, and where nothing can be
printed without having been approved by a rigorous
censorship, sounds almost like irony. And yet, notwithstanding
all the efforts of the Government to prevent the
discussion of political matters in the Press, or even in private
circles, that discussion goes on, under all possible aspects and
under all imaginable pretexts. As a result it would be no
exaggeration to say that in the necessarily narrow circle of
educated Russian “intellectuals” there is as much knowledge,
all round, of matters political as there is in the educated
circles of any other European country, and that a certain
knowledge of the political life of other nations is wide-spread
among the reading portion of Russians.</p>

<p>It is well known that everything that is printed in Russia,
even up to the present time, is submitted to censorship, either
before it goes to print, or afterwards. To found a review
or a paper the editor must offer satisfactory guarantees of
not being “too advanced” in his political opinions, otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
he will not be authorised by the Ministry of the Interior
to start the paper or the review and to act in the capacity of
its editor. In certain cases a paper or a review, published in
one of the two capitals but never in the provinces, may be
allowed to appear without passing through the censor’s hands
before going to print; but a copy of it must be sent to the
censor as soon as the printing begins, and every number may
be stopped and prevented from being put into circulation
before it has left the printing office, to say nothing of subsequent
prosecution. The same condition of things exists for
books. Even after the paper or the book has been authorised
by the censor it may be subject to a prosecution. The law of
1864 was very definite in stating the conditions under which
such prosecution could take place; namely, it had to be made
before a regular court, within one month after publication;
but this law was never respected by the Government. Books
were seized and destroyed—reduced to pulp—without the
affair ever being brought before a Court, and I know editors
who have been plainly warned that if they insisted upon this
being done, they would simply be exiled, by order of the
administration, to some remote province. This is not all,
moreover. A paper or a review may receive a first, a second,
and a third warning, and after the third warning it is suspended,
by virtue of that warning. Besides, the Ministry of
the Interior may at any time prohibit the sale of the paper
in the streets and the shops, or deprive the paper of the right
of inserting advertisements.</p>

<p>The arsenal of punishments is thus pretty large; but there
is still something else. It is the system of ministerial circulars.
Suppose a strike takes place, or some scandalous bribery
has been discovered in some branch of the administration.
Immediately all papers and reviews receive a circular from
the Ministry of the Interior prohibiting them to speak of
that strike, or that scandal. Even less important matters will
be tabooed in this way. Thus a few years ago an anti-Semitic
comedy was put on the stage at St. Petersburg. It was imbued
with the worst spirit of national hatred towards the Jews,
and the actress who was given the main part in it refused
to play. She preferred to break her agreement with the manager
rather than to play in that comedy. Another actress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
was engaged. This became known to the public, and at the
first representation a formidable demonstration was made
against the actors who had accepted parts in the play, and
also against the author. Some eighty arrests—chiefly of students
and other young people and of litterateurs—were made
from among the audience, and for two days the St. Petersburg
papers were full of discussions of the incident; but then
came the ministerial circular prohibiting any further reference
to the subject, and on the third day there was not a word
said about the matter in all the Press of Russia.</p>

<p>Socialism, the social question altogether, and the labour
movement are continually tabooed by ministerial circulars—to
say nothing of Society and Court scandals, or of the thefts
which may be discovered from time to time in the higher
administration. At the end of the reign of Alexander II. the
theories of Darwin, Spencer, and Buckle were tabooed in the
same way, and their works were prevented from being kept
by the circulating libraries.</p>

<p>This is what censorship means nowadays. As to what was
formerly, a very amusing book could be made of the antics
of the different censors, simply by utilising Skabitchévskiy’s
<i>History of Censorship</i>. Suffice it to say that when Púshkin,
speaking of a lady, wrote: “Your divine features,” or mentioned
“her celestial beauty,” the censorship would cross out
these verses and write, in red ink on the MS., that such
expressions were offensive to divinity and could not be
allowed. Verses were mutilated without any regard to the
rules of versification; and very often the censor introduced,
in a novel, scenes of his own.</p>

<p>Under such conditions political thought had continually
to find new channels for its expression. Quite a special
language was developed therefore in the reviews and papers
for the treatment of forbidden subjects and for expressing
ideas which censorship would have found objectionable; and
this way of writing was resorted to even in works of art. A
few words dropped by a Rúdin, or by a Bazároff in a novel
by Turguéneff, conveyed quite a world of ideas. However,
other channels besides mere allusion were necessary, and
therefore political thought found its expression in various
other ways: first of all, in literary and philosophical circles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
which impressed their stamp on the entire literature of a
given epoch; then, in art-criticism, in satire, and in literature
published abroad, either in Switzerland or in England.</p>

<h3>THE “CIRCLES”—WESTERNERS AND SLAVOPHILES</h3>

<p>It was especially in the forties and fifties of the nineteenth
century that “the circles” played an important part in the
intellectual development of Russia. No sort of expression of
political thought in print was possible at that time. The two
or three semi-official newspapers which were allowed to
appear were absolutely worthless; the novel, the drama, the
poem, had to deal with the most superficial matters only, and
the heaviest books of science and philosophy were as liable
to be prohibited as the lighter sort of literature. Private intercourse
was the only possible means of exchanging ideas, and
therefore all the best men of the time joined some “circle,”
in which more or less advanced ideas were expressed in
friendly conversation. There are even men like <span class="smcap">Stankévitch</span>
(1817-1840) who are mentioned in every course of Russian
literature, although they have never written anything, simply
for the moral influence they exercised within their circle.
(Turguéneff’s <i>Yákov Pásynkoff</i> was inspired by such a
personality.)</p>

<p>It is quite evident that under such conditions there was no
room for the development of political parties properly speaking.
However, from the middle of the nineteenth century
two main currents of philosophical and social thought, which
took the name of “Western” and “Slavophile,” were
always apparent. The Westerners were, broadly speaking, for
Western civilisation. Russia—they maintained—is no exception
in the great family of European nations. She will
necessarily pass through the same phases of development that
Western Europe has passed through, and consequently her
next step will be the abolition of serfdom and, after that, the
evolution of the same constitutional institutions as have been
evolved in Western Europe. The Slavophiles, on the other
side, maintained that Russia has a mission of her own. She
has not known foreign conquest like that of the Normans;
she has retained still the structure of the old clan period, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
therefore she must follow her own quite original lines of
development, in accordance with what the Slavophiles described
as the three fundamental principles of Russian life:
the Greek Orthodox Church, the absolute power of the Tsar,
and the principles of the patriarchal family.</p>

<p>These were, of course, very wide programmes, which
admitted of many shades of opinion and gradations. Thus,
for the great bulk of the Westerners, Western liberalism of
the Whig or the Guizot type was the highest ideal that
Russia had to strive for. They maintained moreover that
everything which has happened in Western Europe in the
course of her evolution—such as the depopulation of the
villages, the horrors of freshly developing capitalism (revealed
in England by the Parliamentary Commissions of the
forties), the powers of bureaucracy which had developed in
France, and so on, must necessarily be repeated in Russia as
well: they were unavoidable <i>laws</i> of evolution. This was the
opinion of the rank-and-file “Westerner.”</p>

<p>The more intelligent and the better educated representatives
of this same party—Byelínskiy, Hérzen, Turguéneff,
Tchernyshévskiy, who were all under the influence of advanced
European thought, held quite different views. In
their opinion the hardships suffered by workingmen and
agricultural labourers in Western Europe from the unbridled
power won in the parliaments, by both the landlords and the
middle classes, and the limitations of political liberties
introduced in the continental States of Europe by their
bureaucratic centralisation, were by no means “historical
necessities.” Russia—they maintained—need not necessarily
repeat these mistakes; she must on the contrary, profit by the
experience of her elder sisters, and if Russia succeeds in attaining
the era of industrialism without having lost her
communal land-ownership, or the autonomy of certain parts
of the Empire, or the self-government of the <i>mir</i> in her
villages, this will be an immense advantage. It would be
therefore the greatest political mistake to go on destroying
her village community, to let the land concentrate in the
hands of a landed aristocracy, and to let the political life of
so immense and varied a territory be concentrated in the
hands of a central governing body, in accordance with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Prussian, or the Napoleonic ideals of political centralisation—especially
now that the powers of Capitalism are so great.</p>

<p>Similar gradations of opinion prevailed among the Slavophiles.
Their best representatives—the two brothers <span class="smcap">Aksákoff</span>,
the two brothers <span class="smcap">Kiréevskiy</span>, <span class="smcap">Homyakóff</span>, etc.,
were much in advance of the great bulk of the party. The
average Slavophile was simply a fanatic of absolute rule
and the Orthodox Church, to which feelings he usually added
a sort of sentimental attachment to the “old good times,”
by which he understood all sorts of things: patriarchal habits
of the times of serfdom, manners of country life, folk songs,
traditions, and folk-dress. At a time when the real history of
Russia had hardly begun to be deciphered they did not even
suspect that the federalist principle had prevailed in Russia
down to the Mongol invasion; that the authority of the
Moscow Tsars was of a relatively late creation (15th, 16th
and 17th centuries); and that autocracy was not at all an
inheritance of <i>old</i> Russia, but was chiefly the work of that
same Peter I. whom they execrated for having violently introduced
Western habits of life. Few of them realised also that
the religion of the great mass of the Russian people was <i>not</i>
the religion which is professed by the official “Orthodox”
Church, but a thousand varieties of “Dissent.” They thus
imagined that they represented the ideals of the Russian
<i>people</i>, while in reality they represented the ideals of the
Russian <i>State</i>, and the Moscow <i>Church</i>, which are of a
mixed Byzantine, Latin, and Mongolian origin. With the
aid of the fogs of German metaphysics—especially of Hegel—which
were in great vogue at that time, and with that love
of abstract terminology which prevailed in the first half of
the nineteenth century, discussion upon such themes could
evidently last for years without coming to a definite
conclusion.</p>

<p>However, with all that, it must be owned that, through
their best representatives, the Slavophiles powerfully contributed
towards the creation of a school of history and law
which put historical studies in Russia on a true foundation,
by making a sharp distinction between the history and the law
of the Russian <i>State</i> and the history and the law of the
Russian <i>people</i>. <span class="smcap">Kostomároff</span> (1818-1885), <span class="smcap">Zabyélin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></span>
(born 1820) and <span class="smcap">Byeláeff</span> (1810-1873), were the
first to write the real history of the Russian people, and of
these three, the two last were Slavophiles; while the former—an
Ukraïnian nationalist—had also borrowed from the
Slavophiles their scientific ideas. They brought into evidence
the federalistic character of early Russian history. They destroyed
the legend, propagated by Karamzín, of an uninterrupted
transmission of royal power, that was supposed to
have taken place for a thousand years, from the times of
the Norman Rúrik till to-day. They brought into evidence the
violent means by which the princes of Moscow crushed the
independent city-republics of the pre-Mongolian period, and
gradually, with the aid of the Mongol Khans, became the
Tsars of Russia; and they told (especially Byeláeff, in his
<i>History of the Peasants in Russia</i>) the gruesome tale of
the growth of serfdom from the seventeenth century, under
the Moscow Tsars. Besides, it is mainly to the Slavophiles
that we owe the recognition of the fact that two different
codes exist in Russia—the Code of the Empire, which is the
code of the educated classes, and the Common Law, which is
(like the Norman law in Jersey) widely different from the
former, and very often preferable, in its conceptions of land-ownership,
inheritance, etc., and is the law which prevails
among the peasants, its details varying in different provinces.
The recognition of this fact has already had far-reaching
consequences in the whole life of Russia and her colonies.</p>

<p>In the absence of political life the philosophical and
literary struggles between the Slavophiles and the Westerners
absorbed the minds of the best men of the literary circles of
St. Petersburg and Moscow in the years 1840-1860. The
question whether or not each nationality is the bearer of some
pre-determined mission in history, and whether Russia has
some such special mission, was eagerly discussed in the circles
to which, in the forties, belonged Bakúnin, the critic Byelínskiy,
Hérzen, Turguéneff, the Aksákoffs and the Kiréevskiys,
Kavélin, Bótkin, and, in fact, all the best men of the time.
But when later on serfdom was being abolished (in 1857-63)
the very realities of the moment established upon certain
important questions the most remarkable agreement between
Slavophiles and Westerners, the most advanced socialistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
Westerners, like Tchernyshévskiy, joining hands with the
advanced Slavophiles in their desire to maintain the really
fundamental institutions of the Russian peasants: the village
community, the common law, and the federalistic principles;
while the more advanced Slavophiles made substantial concessions
as regards the “Western” ideals embodied in the
Declaration of Independence, and the Declaration of the
Rights of Man. It was to these years (1861) that Turguéneff
alluded when he said that in <i>A Nobleman’s Retreat</i>, in
the discussion between Lavrétskiy and Pánshin, he—“an
inveterate Westerner”—had given the superiority in argument
to the defender of Slavophile ideas because of the
deference to them then in real life.</p>

<p>At present the struggle between the Westerners and the
Slavophiles has come to an end. The last representative of
the Slavophile school, the much-regretted philosopher, <span class="smcap">V.
Solovióff</span> (1853-1900), was too well versed in history and
philosophy, and had too broad a mind to go to the extremes
of the old Slavophiles. As to the present representatives of
this school, having none of the inspiration which characterised
its founders, they have sunk to the level of mere
Imperialistic dreamers and warlike Nationalists, or of Orthodox
Ultramontanes, whose intellectual influence is <i>nil</i>. At
the present moment the main struggle goes on between the
defenders of autocracy and those of freedom; the defenders
of capital and those of labour; the defenders of centralisation
and bureaucracy, and those of the republican federalistic
principle, municipal independence, and the independence of
the village community.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL LITERATURE ABROAD</h3>

<p>One great drawback in Russia has been that no portion of
the Slavonian countries has ever obtained political freedom,
as did Switzerland or Belgium, so as to offer to Russian political
refugees an asylum where they would not feel quite
separated from their mother country. Russians, when they
have fled from Russia, have had therefore to go to Switzerland
or to England, where they have remained, until quite
lately, absolute strangers. Even France, with which they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
more points of contact, was only occasionally open to them;
while the two countries nearest to Russia—Germany and
Austria—not being themselves free, remained closed to all
political refugees. In consequence, till quite lately political
and religious emigration from Russia has been insignificant,
and only for a few years in the nineteenth century has political
literature published abroad ever exercised a real influence
in Russia. This was during the times of Hérzen and his paper
<i>The Bell</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hérzen</span> (1812-1870) was born in a rich family at Moscow—his
mother, however, being a German—and he was
educated in the old-nobility quarter of the “Old Equerries.”
A French emigrant, a German tutor, a Russian teacher who
was a great lover of freedom, and the rich library of his
father, composed of French and German eighteenth century
philosophers—these were his education. The reading of the
French encyclopædists left a deep trace in his mind, so that
even later on, when he paid, like all his young friends, a
tribute to the study of German metaphysics, he never
abandoned the concrete ways of thought and the naturalistic
turn of mind which he had borrowed from the French
eighteenth century philosophers.</p>

<p>He entered the Moscow university in its physical and
mathematical department. The French Revolution of 1830
had just produced a deep impression on thinking minds all
over Europe; and a circle of young men, which included
Hérzen, his intimate friend, the poet Ogaryóff, Pássek,
the future explorer of folklore, and several others, came to
spend whole nights in reading and discussing political and
social matters, especially Saint-Simonism. Under the impression
of what they knew about the Decembrists, Hérzen and
Ogaryóff, when they were mere boys, had already taken “the
Hannibal oath” of avenging the memory of these forerunners
of liberty. The result of these youthful gatherings
was that at one of them some song was sung in which there
was disrespectful allusion to Nicholas I. This reached the
ears of the State police. Night searchings were made at the
lodgings of the young men, and all were arrested. Some were
sent to Siberia, and the others would have been marched as
soldiers to a battalion, like Polezháeff and Shevtchénko, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
it not been for the interference of certain persons in high
places. Hérzen was sent to a small town in the Uráls,
Vyátka, and remained full six years In exile.</p>

<p>When he was allowed to return to Moscow, in 1840, he
found the literary circles entirely under the influence of German
philosophy, losing themselves in metaphysical abstractions.
“The absolute” of Hegel, his triad-scheme of human
progress, and his assertion to the effect that “all that exists is
reasonable” were eagerly discussed. This last had brought
the Hegelians to maintain that even the despotism of
Nicholas I. was “reasonable,” and even the great critic Byelínskiy
had been smitten with that recognition of the “historical
necessity” of absolutism. Hérzen too had, of course,
to study Hegel; but this study brought him, as well as his
friend <span class="smcap">Mikhail Bakúnin</span> (1824-1876), to quite different
conclusions. They both acquired a great influence in the
circles, and directed their studies toward the history of the
struggles for liberty in Western Europe, and to a careful
knowledge of the French Socialists, especially Fourier and
Pierre Leroux. They then constituted the left wing of “the
Westerners,” to which Turguéneff, Kavélin and so many of
our writers belonged; while the Slavophiles constituted the
right wing which has already been mentioned on a preceding
page.</p>

<p>In 1842 Hérzen was exiled once more—this time to Nóvgorod,
and only with great difficulties could he obtain
permission to go abroad. He left Russia in 1847, never more
to return. Bakúnin and Ogaryóff were already abroad, and
after a journey to Italy, which was then making heroic efforts
to free itself from the Austrian yoke, he soon joined his
friends in Paris, which was then on the eve of the Revolution
of 1848.</p>

<p>He lived through the youthful enthusiasm of the movement
which embraced all Europe in the spring of 1848, and
he also lived through all the subsequent disappointments and
the massacre of the Paris proletarians during the terrible
days of June. The quarter where he and Turguéneff stayed
at that time was surrounded by a chain of police-agents who
knew them both personally, and they could only rage in their
rooms as they heard the volleys of rifle-shots, announcing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
that the vanquished workingmen who had been taken
prisoners were being shot in batches by the triumphing
<i>bourgeoisie</i>. Both have left most striking descriptions of
those days—Hérzen’s <i>June Days</i> being one of the best pieces
of Russian literature.</p>

<p>Deep despair took hold of Hérzen when all the hopes
raised by the revolution had so rapidly come to nought and
a fearful reaction had spread all over Europe, re-establishing
Austrian rule over Italy and Hungary, paving the way for
Napoleon III. at Paris, and sweeping away everywhere the
very traces of a wide-spread Socialistic movement. Hérzen
then felt a deep despair as regards Western civilisation altogether,
and expressed it in most moving pages, in his book
<i>From the other Shore</i>. It is a cry of despair—the cry of a
prophetic politician in the voice of a great poet.</p>

<p>Later on Hérzen founded, at Paris, with Proudhon, a
paper, <i>L’Ami du Peuple</i>, of which almost every number was
confiscated by the police of Napoleon the Third. The paper
could not live, and Hérzen himself was soon expelled from
France. He was naturalised in Switzerland, and finally, after
the tragic loss of his mother and his son in a shipwreck, he
definitely settled at London in 1857. Here the first leaf of a
free Russian Press was printed that same year, and very soon
Hérzen became one of the strongest influences in Russia. He
started first a review, the name of which, <i>The Polar Star</i>, was
a remembrance of the almanack published under this name
by Ryléeff (see Ch. I.); and in this review he published,
besides political articles and most valuable material concerning
the recent history of Russia, his admirable memoirs—<i>Past
Facts and Thoughts</i>.</p>

<p>Apart from the historical value of these memoirs—Hérzen
knew all the historical personages of his time—they certainly
are one of the best pieces of poetical literature in any
language. The descriptions of men and events which they contain,
beginning with Russia in the forties and ending with the
years of exile, reveal at every step an extraordinary, philosophical
intelligence; a profoundly sarcastic mind, combined
with a great deal of good-natured humour; a deep hatred of
oppressors and a deep personal love for the simple-hearted
heroes of human emancipation. At the same time these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
memoirs contain such fine, poetical scenes from the author’s
personal life, as his love of Nathalie—later his wife—or
such deeply impressive chapters as <i>Oceano Nox</i>, where he
tells about the loss of his son and mother. One chapter of
these memoirs remains still unpublished, and from what Turguéneff
told me about it, it must be of the highest beauty.
“No one has ever written like him,” Turguéneff said: “it
is all written in tears and blood.”</p>

<p>A paper, <i>The Bell</i>, soon followed the <i>Polar Star</i>, and it
was through this paper that the influence of Hérzen became a
real power in Russia. It appears now, from the lately published
correspondence between Turguéneff and Hérzen, that
the great novelist took a very lively part in <i>The Bell</i>. It was
he who supplied his friend Hérzen with the most interesting
material and gave him hints as to what attitude he should
take upon this or that subject.</p>

<p>These were, of course, the years when Russia was on the
eve of the abolition of serfdom and of a thorough reform of
most of the antiquated institutions of Nicholas I., and when
everyone took interest in public affairs. Numbers of memoirs
upon the questions of the day were addressed to the Tsar
by private persons, or simply circulated in private, in MS.;
and Turguéneff would get hold of them, and they would be
discussed in <i>The Bell</i>. At the same time <i>The Bell</i> was revealing
such facts of mal-administration as it was impossible to
bring to public knowledge in Russia itself, while the leading
articles were written by Hérzen with a force, an inner
warmth, and a beauty of form which are seldom found in
political literature. I know of no West European writer with
whom I should be able to compare Hérzen. <i>The Bell</i> was
smuggled into Russia in large quantities and could be found
everywhere. Even Alexander II. and the Empress Marie were
among its regular readers.</p>

<p>Two years after serfdom had been abolished, and while
all sorts of urgently needed reforms were still under discussion—that
is, in 1863—began, as is known, the uprising
of Poland; and this uprising, crushed in blood and on the
gallows, brought the liberation movement in Russia to a complete
end. Reaction got the upper hand; and the popularity
of Hérzen, who had supported the Poles, was necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
gone. <i>The Bell</i> was read no more in Russia, and the efforts
of Hérzen to continue it in French brought no results. A new
generation came then to the front—the generation of Bazároff
and of “the populists,” whom Hérzen did not understand
from the outset, although they were his own intellectual
sons and daughters, dressed now in a new, more democratic
and realistic garb. He died in isolation in Switzerland, in
1870.</p>

<p>The works of Hérzen, even now, are not allowed to be
circulated in Russia, and they are not sufficiently known to
the younger generation. It is certain, however, that when
the time comes for them to be read again Russians will
discover in Hérzen a very profound thinker, whose
sympathies were entirely with the working classes, who
understood the forms of human development in all their complexity,
and who wrote in a style of unequalled beauty—the
best proof that his ideas had been thought out in detail and
under a variety of aspects.</p>

<p>Before he had emigrated and founded a free press at
London, Hérzen had written in Russian reviews under the
name of <span class="smcap">Iskander</span>, treating various subjects, such as Western
politics, socialism, the philosophy of natural sciences, art,
and so on. He also wrote a novel, <i>Whose Fault is it?</i> which
is often spoken of in the history of the development of intellectual
types in Russia. The hero of this novel, Béltoff, is a
direct descendant from Lérmontoff’s Petchórin, and occupies
an intermediate position between him and the heroes of
Turguéneff.</p>

<p>The work of the poet <span class="smcap">Ogaryóff</span> (1813-1877) was not
very large, and his intimate friend, Hérzen, who was a great
master in personal characteristics, could say of him that his
chief life-work was the working out of such an ideal personality
as he was himself. His private life was most unhappy,
but his influence upon his friends was very great. He was a
thorough lover of freedom, who, before he left Russia, set
free his ten thousand serfs, surrendering all the land to
them, and who, throughout all his life abroad remained
true to the ideals of equality and freedom which he had
cherished in his youth. Personally, he was the gentlest imaginable
of men, and a note of resignation, in the sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Schiller’s, sounds throughout his poetry, amongst which
fierce poems of revolt and of masculine energy are few.</p>

<p>As to <span class="smcap">Mikhail Bakúnin</span> (1824-1876), the other great
friend of Hérzen, his work belongs chiefly to the International
Working Men’s Association, and hardly can find a
place in a sketch of Russian literature; but his personal influence
on some of the prominent writers of Russia was very
great. Suffice it to say that Byelínskiy distinctly acknowledged
in his letters that Bakúnin was his “intellectual father,” and
that it was in fact he who infused the Moscow circle, of which
I have just spoken, and the St. Petersburg literary circles
with socialistic ideas. He was the typical revolutionist, whom
nobody could approach without being inspired by a revolutionary
fire. Besides, if advanced thought in Russia has
always remained true to the cause of the different nationalities—Polish,
Finnish, Little Russian, Caucasian—oppressed
by Russian tsardom, or by Austria, it owes this to a very great
extent to Ogaryóff and Bakúnin. In the international labour
movement Bakúnin became the soul of the left wing of the
great Working Men’s Association, and he was the founder
of modern Anarchism, or anti-State Socialism, of which he
laid down the foundations upon his wide historical and
philosophical knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally I must mention among the Russian political
writers abroad, <span class="smcap">Peter Lavróff</span> (1823-1901). He was a
mathematician and a philosopher who represented, under the
name of “anthropologism,” a reconciliation of modern
natural science materialism with Kantianism. He was a
colonel of artillery, a professor of mathematics, and a member
of the St. Petersburg newly-formed municipal government,
when he was arrested and exiled to a small town in the
Uráls. One of the young Socialist circles kidnapped him from
there and shipped him off to London, where he began to
publish in the year 1874 the Socialist review <i>Forward</i>. Lavróff
was an extremely learned encyclopædist who made his
reputation by his <i>Mechanical Theory of the Universe</i> and by
the first chapters of a very exhaustive history of mathematical
sciences. His later work, <i>History of Modern Thought</i>, of
which unfortunately only the four or five introductory
volumes have been published, would certainly have been an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
important contribution to evolutionist philosophy, if it had
been completed. In the socialist movement he belonged to the
social-democratic wing, but was too widely learned and too
much of a philosopher to join the German social-democrats
in their ideals of a centralised communistic State, or in their
narrow interpretation of history. However, the work of
Lavróff which gave him the greatest notoriety and best
expressed his own personality was a small work, <i>Historical
Letters</i>, which he published in Russia under the pseudonym
of <span class="smcap">Mírtoff</span> and which can now be read in a French
translation. This little work appeared at the right moment—just
when our youth, in the years 1870-73, were endeavouring
to find a new programme of action amongst the people.
Lavróff stands out in it as a preacher of activity amongst the
people, speaking to the educated youth of their indebtedness
to the people, and of their duty to repay the debt which they
had contracted towards the poorer classes during the years
they had passed in the universities—all this, developed with
a profusion of historical hints, of philosophical deductions,
and of practical advice. These letters had a deep influence
upon our youth. The ideas which Lavróff preached in 1870
he confirmed by all his subsequent life. He lived to the age
of 82, and passed all his life in strict conformity with his
ideal, occupying at Paris two small rooms, limiting his daily
expenses for food to a ridiculously small amount, earning his
living by his pen, and giving all his time to the spreading of
the ideas which were so dear to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Turguéneff</span> (1789-1871) was a remarkable
political writer, who belonged to two different epochs. In
1818 he published in Russia a <i>Theory of Taxation</i>—a book,
quite striking for its time and country, as it contained the
development of the liberal economical ideas of Adam Smith;
and he was already beginning to work for the abolition of
serfdom. He made a practical attempt by partly freeing his
own serfs, and wrote on this subject several memoirs for the
use of Emperor Alexander I. He also worked for constitutional
rule, and soon became one of the most influential members
of the secret society of the Decembrists; but he was
abroad in December, 1825, and therefore escaped being
executed with his friends. After that time N. Turguéneff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
remained in exile, chiefly at Paris, and in 1857, when an
amnesty was granted to the Decembrists, and he was allowed
to return to Russia, he did so for a few weeks only.</p>

<p>He took, however, a lively part in the emancipation of
the serfs, which he had preached since 1818 and which he
had discussed also in his large work, <i>La Russie et les Russes</i>,
published in Paris in 1847. Now he devoted to this subject
several papers in <i>The Bell</i> and several pamphlets. He continued
at the same time to advocate the convocation of a
General Representative Assembly, the development of provincial
self-government, and other urgent reforms. He died
at Paris in 1871, after having had the happiness which had
come to few Decembrists—that of taking, towards the end
of his days, a practical part in the realisation of one of the
dreams of his youth, for which so many of our noblest men
had given their lives.</p>

<p>I pass over in silence several other writers, like <span class="smcap">Prince
Dolgorúkiy</span>, and especially a number of Polish writers,
who emigrated from Russia for the sake of free speech.</p>

<p>I omit also quite a number of socialistic and constitutional
papers and reviews which have been published in Switzerland
or in England during the last twenty years, and will only
mention, and that only in a few words, my friend <span class="smcap">Stepniak</span>
(1852-1897). His writings were chiefly in English, but now
that they are translated into Russian they will certainly win
for him an honourable place in the history of Russian literature.
His two novels, <i>The Career of a Nihilist</i> (<i>Andréi
Kozhuhóff</i> in Russian) and <i>The Stundist Pável Rudénko</i>, as
also his earlier sketches, <i>Underground Russia</i>, revealed his
remarkable literary talent, but a stupid railway accident put
an end to his young life, so rich in vigour and thought and
so full of promises. It must also be mentioned that the greatest
Russian writer of our own time, <span class="smcap">Leo Tolstóy</span>, cannot
have many of his works printed in Russia, and that therefore
his friend, <span class="smcap">V. Tchertkoff</span>, has started in England a
regular publishing office, both for editing Tolstóy’s works
and for bringing to light the religious movements which are
going on now in Russia, and the prosecutions directed against
them by the Government.</p>

<h3>TCHERNYSHÉVSKIY AND “THE CONTEMPORARY”</h3>

<p>The most prominent among political writers in Russia
itself has undoubtedly been <span class="smcap">Tchernyshévskiy</span> (1828-1889),
whose name is indissolubly connected with that of the
review, <i>Sovreménnik</i> (<i>The Contemporary</i>). The influence
which this review exercised on public opinion in the years of
the abolition of serfdom (1857-62) was equal to that of
Hérzen’s <i>Bell</i>, and this influence was mainly due to Tchernyshévskiy,
and partly to the critic Dobrolúboff.</p>

<p>Tchernyshévskiy was born in Southeastern Russia, at
Sarátoff—his father being a well educated and respected
priest of the cathedral—and his early education he received,
first at home, and next in the Sarátoff seminary. He left the
seminary, however, in 1844, and two years later entered the
philological department of the St. Petersburg University.</p>

<p>The quantity of work which Tchernyshévskiy performed
during his life, and the immensity of knowledge which he
acquired in various branches, was simply stupendous. He
began his literary career by works on philology and literary
criticism; and he wrote in this last branch three remarkable
works, <i>The Æsthetical Relations between Art and Reality</i>,
<i>Sketches of the Gógol period</i>, and <i>Lessing and his Time</i>, in
which he developed a whole theory of æsthetics and literary
criticism. His main work, however, was accomplished during
the four years, 1858-62, when he wrote in <i>The Contemporary</i>,
exclusively on political and economical matters. These
were the years of the abolition of serfdom, and opinion, both
in the public at large and in the Government spheres, was
quite unsettled even as to the leading principles which should
be followed in accomplishing it. The two main questions
were: should the liberated serfs receive the land which they
were cultivating for themselves while they were serfs, and if
so—on what conditions? And next—should the village community
institutions be maintained and the land held, as of old,
in common—the village community becoming in this case the
basis for the future self-government institutions? All the best
men of Russia were in favour of an answer in the affirmative
to both these questions, and even in the higher spheres
opinion went the same way; but all the reactionists and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
“esclavagist” serf-owners of the old school bitterly opposed
this view. They wrote memoirs upon memoirs and addressed
them to the Emperor and the Emancipation Committees, and
it was necessary, of course, to analyse their arguments and to
produce weighty historical and economical proofs against
them. In this struggle Tchernyshévskiy, who was, of course,
as was Hérzen’s <i>Bell</i>, with the advanced party, supported it
with all the powers of his great intelligence, his wide erudition,
and his formidable capacity for work; and if this party
carried the day and finally converted Alexander II. and the
official leaders of the Emancipation Committees to its views,
it was certainly to a great extent owing to the energy of
Tchernyshévskiy and his friends.</p>

<p>It must also be said that in this struggle <i>The Contemporary</i>
and <i>The Bell</i> found a strong support in two advanced political
writers from the Slavophile camp: <span class="smcap">Kósheleff</span> (1806-1883)
and <span class="smcap">Yúriy Samarin</span> (1819-1876). The former had
advocated, since 1847—both in writing and in practise—the
liberation of the serfs “with the land,” the maintenance of
the village community, and peasant self-government, and
now Kósheleff and Samarin, both influential landlords, energetically
supported these ideas in the Emancipation Committees,
while Tchernyshévskiy fought for them in <i>The Contemporary</i>
and in his <i>Letters without an Address</i> (written
apparently to Alexander II. and published only later on in
Switzerland).</p>

<p>No less a service did Tchernyshévskiy render to Russian
Society by educating it in economical matters and in the
history of modern times. In this respect he acted with a wonderful
pedagogical talent. He translated Mill’s <i>Political
Economy</i>, and wrote <i>Notes</i> to it, in a socialistic sense; moreover,
in a series of articles, like <i>Capital and Labour</i>, <i>Economical
Activity and the State</i>, he did his best to spread sound
economic ideas. In the domain of history he did the same,
both in a series of translations and in a number of original
articles upon the struggle of parties in modern France.</p>

<p>In 1863 Tchernyshévskiy was arrested, and while he was
kept in the fortress he wrote a remarkable novel, <i>What is to
be Done?</i> From the artistic point of view this novel leaves
much to be desired; but for the Russian youth of the times it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
was a revelation, and it became a programme. Questions of
marriage, and separation after marriage in case such a separation
becomes necessary, agitated Russian society in those
years. To ignore such questions was absolutely impossible.
And Tchernyshévskiy discussed them in his novel, in describing
the relations between his heroine, Vyéra Pávlovna, her
husband Lopukhóff and the young doctor with whom she fell
in love after her marriage—indicating the only solutions
which perfect honesty and straightforward common sense
could approve in such a case. At the same time he preached—in
veiled words, which were, however, perfectly well
understood—Fourierism, and depicted in a most attractive
form the communistic associations of producers. He also
showed in his novel what true “Nihilists” were, and in what
they differed from Turguéneff’s Bazároff. No novel of Turguéneff
and no writings of Tolstóy or any other writer have
ever had such a wide and deep influence upon Russian Society
as this novel had. It became the watchword of Young Russia,
and the influence of the ideas it propagated has never
ceased to be apparent since.</p>

<p>In 1864 Tchernyshévskiy was exiled to hard labour in
Siberia, for the political and socialist propaganda which he
had been making; and for fear that he might escape from
Transbaikália he was soon transported to a very secluded
spot in the far North of Eastern Siberia—Vilúisk—where
he was kept till 1883. Then only was he allowed to return
to Russia and to settle at Astrakhán. His health, however,
was already quite broken. Nevertheless, he undertook the
translation of the <i>Universal History</i> of Weber, to which he
wrote long addenda, and he had translated twelve volumes
of it when death overtook him in 1889. Storms of polemics
have raged over his grave, although his name, even yet,
cannot be pronounced, nor his ideas discussed, in the Russian
Press. No other man has been so much hated by his political
adversaries as Tchernyshévskiy. But even these are bound
to recognise now the great services he rendered to Russia
during the emancipation of the serfs, and his immense
educational influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<h3>THE SATIRE: SALTYKÓFF</h3>

<p>With all the restrictions imposed upon political literature
in Russia, the satire necessarily became one of the favourite
means of expressing political thought. It would take too
much time to give even a short sketch of the earlier Russian
satirists, as in order to do that one would have to go back
as far as the eighteenth century. Of Gógol’s satire I have
already spoken; consequently I shall limit my remarks under
this head to only one representative of modern satire,
<span class="smcap">Saltykóff</span>, who is better known under his <i>nom-de-plume</i>
of <span class="smcap">Schedrin</span> (1826-1889).</p>

<p>The influence of Saltykóff in Russia was very great, not
only with the advanced section of Russian thought, but
among the general readers as well. He was perhaps one of
Russia’s most popular writers. Here I must make, however,
a personal remark. One may try as much as possible to keep
to an objective standpoint in the appreciation of different
writers, but a subjective element will necessarily interfere,
and I personally must say that although I admire the great
talent of Saltykóff, I never could become as enthusiastic over
his writings as the very great majority of my friends did.
Not that I dislike satire: on the contrary; but I like it much
more definite than it is in Saltykóff. I fully recognise that his
remarks were sometimes extremely deep, and always correct,
and that in many cases he foresaw coming events long before
the common reader could guess their approach; I fully
admit that the satirical characterisations he gave of different
classes of Russian society belong to the domain of good art,
and that his types are really typical—and yet, with all this,
I find that these excellent characterisations and these acute
remarks are too much lost amidst a deluge of insignificant
talk, which was certainly meant to conceal their point from
the censorship, but which mitigates the sharpness of the
satire and tends chiefly to deaden its effect. Consequently,
I prefer, in my appreciation of Saltykóff to follow our best
critics, and especially <span class="smcap">K. K. Arsénieff</span>, to whom we owe
two volumes of excellent <i>Critical Studies</i>.</p>

<p>Saltykóff began his literary career very early and, like
most of our best writers, he knew something of exile. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
1848 he wrote a novel, <i>A Complicated Affair</i>, in which some
socialistic tendencies were expressed in the shape of a dream
of a certain poor functionary. It so happened that the novel
appeared in print just a few weeks after the February revolution
of 1848 had broken out, and when the Russian
Government was especially on the alert. Saltykóff was thereupon
exiled to Vyátka, a miserable provincial town in East
Russia, and was ordered to enter the civil service. The exile
lasted seven years, during which he became thoroughly
acquainted with the world of functionaries grouped around
the Governor of the Province. Then in 1857 better times
came for Russian literature, and Saltykóff, who was allowed
to return to the capitals, utilised his knowledge of provincial
life in writing a series of <i>Provincial Sketches</i>.</p>

<p>The impression produced by these <i>Sketches</i> was simply
tremendous. All Russia talked of them. Saltykóff’s talent
appeared in them in its full force, and with them was opened
quite a new era in Russian literature. A great number of
imitators began in their turn to dissect the Russian administration
and the failure of its functionaries. Of course,
something of the sort had already been done by Gógol, but
Gógol, who wrote twenty years before, was compelled to
confine himself to generalities, while Saltykóff was enabled
to name things by their names and to describe provincial
society as it was—denouncing the venal nature of the functionaries,
the rottenness of the whole administration, the
absence of comprehension of what was vital in the life of
the country, and so on.</p>

<p>When Saltykóff was permitted to return to St. Petersburg,
after his exile, he did not abandon the service of the State,
which he had been compelled to enter at Vyátka. With but
a short interruption he remained a functionary till the year
1868, and twice during that time he was Vice-Governor,
and even Governor of a province. It was only then that he
definitely left the service, to act, with Nekrásoff, as co-editor
of a monthly review, <i>Otéchestvennyia Zapíski</i>, which became
after <i>The Contemporary</i> had been suppressed, the representative
of advanced democratic thought in Russia, and
retained this position till 1884, when it was suppressed in
its turn. By that time the health of Saltykóff was broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
down, and after a very painful illness, during which he
nevertheless continued to write, he died in 1889.</p>

<p>The <i>Provincial Sketches</i> determined once for all the character
of Saltykóff’s work. His talent only deepened as he
advanced in life, and his satires went more and more profoundly
into the analysis of modern civilised life, of the
many causes which stand in the way of progress, and of
the infinity of forms which the struggle of reaction against
progress is taking nowadays. In his <i>Innocent Tales</i> he
touched upon some of the most tragic aspects of serfdom.
Then, in his representation of the modern knights of industrialism
and plutocracy, with their appetites for money-making
and enjoyments of the lower sort, their heartlessness,
and their hopeless meanness, Saltykóff attained the
heights of descriptive art; but he excelled perhaps even
more in the representation of that “average man” who
has no great passions, but for the mere sake of not being
disturbed in the process of enjoyment of his philistine well-being
will not recoil before any crime against the best men
of his time, and, if need be, will lend a ready hand to the
worst enemies of progress. In flagellating that “average
man,” who, owing to his unmitigated cowardice, has attained
such a luxurious development in Russia, Saltykóff produced
his greatest creations. But when he came to touch those who
are the real geniuses of reaction—those who keep “the
average man” in fear, and inspire reaction, if need be,
with audacity and ferocity—then Saltykóff’s satire either
recoiled before its task, or the attack was veiled in so many
funny and petty expressions and words that all its venom
was gone.</p>

<p>When reaction had obtained the upper hand, in 1863,
and the carrying out of the reforms of 1861 and of those
still to be undertaken fell into the hands of the very opponents
of these reforms, and the former serf-owners were
doing all they could in order to recall serfdom once again
to life, or, at least, so to bind the peasant by over-taxation
and high rents as to practically enslave him once more,
Saltykóff brought out a striking series of satires which admirably
represented this new class of men. <i>The History of a
City</i>, which is a comic history of Russia, full of allusions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
contemporary currents of thought. <i>The Diary of a Provincial
in St. Petersburg</i>, <i>Letters from the Provinces</i>, and <i>The Pompadours</i>
belong to this series; while in <i>Those Gentlemen of
Tashkent</i> he represented all that crowd which hastened
now to make fortunes by railway building, advocacy in
reformed tribunals, and annexation of new territories. In
these sketches, as well as in those which he devoted to
the description of the sad and sometimes psychologically
unsound products of the times of serfdom (<i>The Gentlemen
Golovlóffs</i>, <i>Poshekhónsk Antiquity</i>), he created types, some
of which, like Judushka, have been described as almost
Shakespearian.</p>

<p>Finally, in the early eighties, when the terrible struggle
of the terrorists against autocracy was over, and with the
advent of Alexander III. reaction was triumphant, the
satires of Schedrin became a cry of despair. At times the
satirist becomes great in his sad irony, and his <i>Letters to
my Aunt</i> will live, not only as an historical but also as a
deeply human document.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of note that Saltykóff had a real talent
for writing tales. Some of them, especially those which dealt
with children under serfdom, were of great beauty.</p>

<h3>LITERARY CRITICISM</h3>

<p>The main channel through which political thought found
its expression in Russia during the last fifty years was literary
criticism, which consequently has reached with us a
development and an importance that it has in no other
country. The real soul of a Russian monthly review is its art-critic.
His article is a much greater event than the novel of a
favourite writer which may appear in the same number. The
critic of a leading review is the intellectual leader of the
younger generation; and it so happened that throughout
the last half-century we have had in Russia a succession of
art-critics who have exercised upon the intellectual aspects of
their own times a far greater, and especially a far more wide-spread
influence than any novelist or any writer in any other
domain. It is so generally true that the intellectual aspect of a
given epoch can be best characterised by naming the art-critic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
of the time who exercised the main influence. It was Byelínskiy
in the thirties or forties, Tchernyshévskiy and Dobrolúboff
in the fifties and the early sixties, and Písareff in the
later sixties and seventies, who were respectively the rulers
of thoughts in their generation of educated youth. It was
only later on, when real political agitation began—taking at
once two or three different directions, even in the advanced
camp—that Mihailóvskiy, the leading critic from the eighties
until the present time, stood not for the whole movement
but more or less for one of its directions.</p>

<p>This means, of course, that literary criticism has in Russia
certain special aspects. It is not limited to a criticism of works
of art from the purely literary or æsthetic point of view.
Whether a Rúdin or a Katerína are types of real, living
beings, and whether the novel or the drama is well built,
well developed, and well written—these are, of course, the
first questions considered. But they are soon answered; and
there are infinitely more important questions, which are
raised in the thoughtful mind by every work of really good
art: the questions concerning the position of a Rúdin or a
Katerína in society; the part, bad or good, which they play
in it; the ideas which inspire them, and the value of these
ideas; and then—the actions of the heroes, and the causes
of these actions, both individual and social. In a good work
of art the actions of the heroes are evidently what they would
have been under similar conditions in reality; otherwise it
would not be good art. They can be discussed as facts of
life.</p>

<p>But these actions and their causes and consequences open
the widest horizons to a thoughtful critic, for an appreciation
of both the ideals and the prejudices of society, for
the analysis of passions, for a discussion of the types of men
and women which prevail at a given moment. In fact, a good
work of art gives material for discussing nearly the whole
of the mutual relations in a society of a given type. The
author, if he is a thoughtful poet, has himself either consciously
or often unconsciously considered all that. It is his
life-experience which he gives in his work. Why, then, should
not the critic bring before the reader all those thoughts
which must have passed through the author’s brain, or have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
affected him unconsciously when he produced these scenes,
or pictured that corner of human life?</p>

<p>This is what Russian literary critics have been doing for
the last fifty years; and as the field of fiction and poetry is
unlimited, there is not one of the great social and human
problems which they must not thus have discussed in their
critical reviews. This is also why the works of the four
critics just named are as eagerly read and re-read now at
this moment as they were twenty or fifty years ago: they
have lost nothing of their freshness and interest. If art is
a school of life—the more so are such works.</p>

<p>It is extremely interesting to note that art-criticism in
Russia took from the very outset (in the twenties) and quite
independently of all imitation of Western Europe, the character
of <i>philosophical æsthetics</i>. The revolt against pseudo-classicism
had only just begun under the banner of romanticism,
and the appearance of Púshkin’s <i>Ruslán and Ludmíla</i>
had just given the first practical argument in favour of the
romantic rebels, when the poet <span class="smcap">Venevítinoff</span> (see Ch.
II.), soon followed by <span class="smcap">Nadézhdin</span> (1804-1856) and <span class="smcap">Polevóy</span>
(1796-1846)—the real founder of serious journalism
in Russia—laid the foundations of new art-criticism. Literary
criticism, they maintained, must analyse, not only the
æsthetic value of a work of art, but, above all, its leading
idea—its “philosophical,”—its social meaning.</p>

<p>Venevítinoff, whose own poetry bore such a high intellectual
stamp, boldly attacked the absence of higher ideas
among the Russian romantics, and wrote that “the true
poets of all nations have always been philosophers who
reached the highest summits of culture.” A poet who is satisfied
with his own self, and does not pursue aims of general
improvement, is of no use to his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Nadézhdin followed on the same lines, and boldly
attacked Púshkin for his absence of higher inspiration and
for producing a poetry of which the only motives were
“wine and women.” He reproached our romantics with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
an absence of ethnographical and historic truth in their
work, and the meanness of the subjects they chose in their
poetry. As to Polevóy, he was so great an admirer of the
poetry of Byron and Victor Hugo that he could not pardon
Púshkin and Gógol the absence of higher ideas in their work.
Having nothing in it that might raise men to higher ideas
and actions, their work could stand no comparison whatever
with the immortal creations of Shakespeare, Hugo, and
Goethe. This absence of higher leading ideas in the work
of Púshkin and Gógol so much impressed the last two critics
that they did not even notice the immense service which these
founders of Russian literature were rendering to us by introducing
that sound naturalism and realism which have
become since a distinctive feature of Russian art, and the
need of which both Nadézhdin and Polevóy were the first
to recognise. It was Byelínskiy who had to take up their
work, to complete it, and to show what was the technique
of really good art, and what its contents ought to be.</p>

<p>To say that <span class="smcap">Byelínskiy</span> (1810-1848) was a very gifted
art-critic would thus mean nothing. He was in reality, at
a very significant moment of human evolution, a teacher and
an educator of Russian society, not only in art—its value, its
purport, its comprehension—but also in politics, in social
questions, and in humanitarian aspirations.</p>

<p>He was the son of an obscure army-surgeon, and spent
his childhood in a remote province of Russia. Well prepared
by his father, who knew the value of knowledge, he entered
the university of St. Petersburg, but was excluded from it
in 1832 for a tragedy which he wrote, in the style of
Schiller’s <i>Robbers</i>, and which was an energetic protest
against serfdom. Already he had joined the circle of
Hérzen, Ogaryóff, Stankévitch, etc., and in 1834 he began
his literary career by a critical review of literature which
at once attracted notice. From that time till his death he
wrote critical articles and bibliographical notes for some
of the leading reviews, and he worked so extremely hard
that at the age of thirty-eight he died from consumption. He
did not die too soon. The revolution had broken out in Western
Europe, and when Byelínskiy was on his deathbed an
agent of the State-police would call from time to time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
ascertain whether he was still alive. The order was given to
arrest him, if he should recover, and his fate certainly would
have been the fortress and at the best—exile.</p>

<p>When Byelínskiy first began to write he was entirely
under the influence of the idealistic German philosophy. He
was inclined to maintain that Art is something too great and
too pure to have anything to do with the questions of the
day. It was a reproduction of “the general idea of the life
of nature.” Its problems were those of the Universe—not
of poor men and their petty events. It was from this idealistic
point of view of Beauty and Truth that he exposed the main
principles of Art, and explained the process of artistic creation.
In a series of articles on Púshkin he wrote, in fact, a
history of Russian literature down to Púshkin, from that
point of view.</p>

<p>Holding such abstract views, Byelínskiy even came, during
his stay at Moscow, to consider, with Hegel, that “all
that which exists is reasonable,” and to preach “reconciliation”
with the despotism of Nicholas I. However, under
the influence of Hérzen and Bakúnin he soon shook off the
fogs of German metaphysics, and, removing to St. Petersburg,
opened a new page of his activity.</p>

<p>Under the impression produced upon him by the realism
of Gógol, whose best works were just appearing, he came to
understand that true poetry is real: that it must be a poetry
of life and of reality. And under the influence of the political
movement which was going on in France he arrived at
advanced political ideas. He was a great master of style,
and whatever he wrote was so full of energy, and at the
same time bore so truly the stamp of his most sympathetic
personality, that it always produced a deep impression upon
his readers. And now all his aspirations towards what is
grand and high, and all his boundless love of truth, which
he formerly had given in the service of personal self-improvement
and ideal Art, were given to the service of
man within the poor conditions of Russian reality. He
pitilessly analysed that reality, and wherever he saw in the
literary works which passed under his eyes, or only felt,
insincerity, haughtiness, absence of general interest, attachment
to old-age despotism, or slavery in any form—including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
the slavery of woman—he fought these evils with all
his energy and passion. He thus became a political writer in
the best sense of the word at the same time that he was an
art-critic; he became a teacher of the highest humanitarian
principles.</p>

<p>In his <i>Letter to Gógol</i> concerning the latter’s <i>Correspondence
with Friends</i> (see Ch. III.) he gave quite a programme
of urgent social and political reforms; but his days were
numbered. His review of the literature for the year 1847,
which was especially beautiful and deep, was his last work.
Death spared him from seeing the dark cloud of reaction
in which Russia was wrapped from 1848 to 1855.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valerián Máykoff</span> (1823-1847), who promised to
become a critic of great power on the same lines as Byelínskiy,
died unfortunately too young, and it was Tchernyshévskiy,
soon followed by Dobrolúboff, who continued and
further developed the work of Byelínskiy and his predecessors.</p>

<p>The leading idea of <span class="smcap">Tchernyshévskiy</span> was that art cannot
be its own aim; that life is superior to art; and that the
aim of art is <i>to explain life</i>, <i>to comment upon it</i>, and <i>to
express an opinion about it</i>. He developed these ideas in a
thoughtful and stimulating work, <i>The Æsthetic Relations of
Art to Reality</i>, in which he demolished the current theories of
æsthetics, and gave a realistic definition of the Beautiful.
The sensation—he wrote—which the Beautiful awakens in
us is a feeling of bright happiness, similar to that which
is awakened by the presence of a beloved being. It must
therefore contain something dear to us, and that dear something
is <i>life</i>. “To say that that which we name ‘Beauty’
is life; that that being is beautiful in which we see life—life
as it ought to be according to our conception—and that
object is beautiful which speaks to us of life—this definition,
we should think, satisfactorily explains all cases which
awaken in us the feeling of the beautiful.” The conclusion
to be drawn from such a definition was that the beautiful
in art, far from being superior to the beautiful in life, can
only represent that conception of the beautiful which the
artist has borrowed from life. As to the aim of art it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
much the same as that of science, although its means of
action are different. The true aim of art is to remind us of
what is interesting in human life, and to teach us how men
live and how they ought to live. This last part of Tchernyshévskiy
teachings was especially developed by Dobrolúboff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dobrolúboff</span> (1836-1861) was born in Nízhniy Nóvgorod,
where his father was a parish priest, and he received
his education first in a clerical school, and after that in a
seminarium. In 1853 he went to St. Petersburg and entered
the Pedagogical Institute. His mother and father died the
next year, and he had then to maintain all his brothers and
sisters. Lessons, for which he was paid ridiculously low
prices, and translations, almost equally badly paid—all that
in addition to his student’s duties—meant working terribly
hard, and this broke down his health at an early age. In
1855 he made the acquaintance of Tchernyshévskiy and,
having finished in 1857 his studies at the Institute, he took
in hand the critical department of <i>The Contemporary</i>, and
again worked passionately. Four years later, in November,
1861, he died, at the age of twenty-five, having literally killed
himself by overwork, leaving four volumes of critical essays,
each of which is a serious original work. Such essays as <i>The
Kingdom of Darkness</i>, <i>A Ray of Light</i>, <i>What is Oblómoffdom?</i>
<i>When comes the Real Day?</i> had especially a profound
effect on the development of the youth of those times.</p>

<p>Not that Dobrolúboff had a very definite criterion of
literary criticism, or that he had a very distinct programme
as to what was to be done. But he was one of the
purest and the most solid representatives of that type
of new men—the realist-idealist, whom Turguéneff saw
coming by the end of the fifties. Therefore, in whatever he
wrote one felt the thoroughly moral and thoroughly reliable,
slightly ascetic “rigourist” who judged all facts of life from
the standard of—“What good will they bring to the toiling
masses?” or, “How will they favour the creation of men
whose eyes are directed that way?” His attitude towards
professional æsthetics was most contemptuous, but he felt
deeply himself and enjoyed the great works of art. He did
not condemn Púshkin for his levity, or Gógol for his absence
of ideals. He did not advise anyone to write novels or poems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
with a set purpose: he knew the results would be poor. He
admitted that the great geniuses were right in creating unconsciously,
because he understood that the real artist creates
only when he has been struck by this or that aspect of reality.
He asked only from a work of art, whether it truly and correctly
reproduced life, or not? If not, he passed it by; but
if it did truly represent life, then he wrote essays <i>about this
life</i>; and his articles were essays on moral, political or
economical matters—the work of art yielding only the facts
for such a discussion. This explains the influence Dobrolúboff
exercised upon his contemporaries. Such essays written
by such a personality were precisely what was wanted in
the turmoil of those years for preparing better men for the
coming struggles. They were a school of political and moral
education.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PÍSAREFF</span> (1841-1868), the critic who succeeded, so to
speak, Dobrolúboff, was a quite different man. He was born
in a rich family of landlords and had received an education
during which he had never known what it meant to want
anything; but he soon realised the drawbacks of such a life,
and when he was at the St. Petersburg university he abandoned
the rich house of his uncle and settled with a poor
student comrade, or lived in an apartment with a number
of other students—writing amidst their noisy discussions or
songs. Like Dobrolúboff, he worked excessively hard, and
astonished everyone by his varied knowledge and the facility
with which he acquired it. In 1862, when reaction was beginning
to reappear, he permitted a comrade to print in a secret
printing office an article of his—the criticism of some reactionary
political pamphlet—which article had not received
the authorisation of the censorship. The secret printing office
was seized, and Písareff was locked for four years in the
fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul. There he wrote all that
made him widely known in Russia. When he came out of
prison his health was already broken, and in the summer of
1868 he was drowned while bathing in one of the Baltic
sea-side resorts.</p>

<p>Upon the Russian youth of his own time, and consequently
on whatever share, as men and women later on, they brought
to the general progress of the country, Písareff exercised an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
influence which was as great as that of Byelínskiy, Tchernyshévskiy,
and Dobrolúboff. Here again it is impossible to
determine the character and the cause of this influence by
merely referring to Písareff’s canons in art criticism. His
leading ideas on this subject can be explained in a few
words; his ideal was “the thoughtful realist”—the type
which Turguéneff had just represented in Bazároff, and
which Písareff further developed in his critical essays. He
shared Bazároff’s low opinion of art, but, as a concession,
demanded that Russian art should, at least, reach the heights
which art had reached with Goethe, Heine and Börne in
elevating mankind—or else that those who are always talking
of art, but can produce nothing approaching it, should
rather give their forces to something more within their
reach. This is why he devoted most elaborate articles to
depreciating the futile poetry of Púshkin. In ethics he was
entirely at one with the “Nihilist” Bazároff, who bowed
before no authority but that of his own reason. And he
thought (like Bazároff in a conversation with Pável Petróvitch)
that the main point, <i>at that given moment</i>, was to
develop the <i>thorough, scientifically-educated realist</i>, who
would break with all the traditions and mistakes of the olden
time, and would work, looking upon human life with the
sound common-sense of a realist. He even did something
himself to spread the sound natural science knowledge that
had suddenly developed in those years, and wrote a most
remarkable exposition of Darwinism in a series of articles
entitled <i>Progress in the World of Plants and Animals</i>.</p>

<p>But—to quote the perfectly correct estimate of Skabitchévskiy—“all
this does not, however, determine
Písareff’s position in Russian literature. In all this he only
embodied a certain moment of the development of Russian
youth, with all its exaggerations.” The real cause of Písareff’s
influence was elsewhere, and may be best explained
by the following example. There appeared a novel in which
the author had told how a girl, good-hearted, honest, but
quite uneducated, quite commonplace as to her conceptions
of happiness and life, and full of the current society-prejudices,
fell in love, and was brought to all sorts of misfortunes.
This girl—Písareff at once understood—was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
invented. Thousands upon thousands of like girls exist, and
their lives have the same run. They are—he said—“Muslin
Girls.” Their conception of the universe does not go much
beyond their muslin dresses. And he reasoned, how with
their “muslin education” and their “muslin-girl conceptions,”
they must unavoidably come to grief. And by this
article, which every girl in every educated family in Russia
read, and reads still, he induced thousands upon thousands
of Russian girls to say to themselves: “No, never will I
be like that poor muslin girl. I will conquer knowledge; I
will think; and I will make for myself a better future.” Each
of his articles had a similar effect. It gave to the young mind
the first shock. It opened the young man’s and the young
woman’s eyes to those thousands of details of life which
habit makes us cease to perceive, but the sum of which makes
precisely that stifling atmosphere under which the heroines
of “Krestóvskiy-pseudonym” used to wither. From that
life, which could promise only deception, dulness and vegetative
existence, he called the youth of both sexes to a life
full of the light of knowledge, a life of work, of broad
views and sympathies, which was now opened for the
“thoughtful realist.”</p>

<p>The time has not yet come to fully appreciate the work of
<span class="smcap">Mihailóvskiy</span> (1842-1904), who in the seventies became
the leading critic, and remained so till his death. Moreover,
his proper position could not be understood without my entering
into many details concerning the character of the intellectual
movement in Russia for the last thirty years, and this
movement has been extremely complex. Suffice it to say that
with Mihailóvskiy literary criticism took a philosophical turn.
Within this period Spencer’s philosophy had produced a
deep sensation in Russia, and Mihailóvskiy submitted it to
a severe analysis from the anthropological standpoint, showing
its weak points and working out his own <i>Theory of
Progress</i>, which will certainly be spoken of with respect in
Western Europe when it becomes known outside Russia.
His very remarkable articles on <i>Individualism</i>, on <i>Heroes
and the Crowd</i>, on <i>Happiness</i>, have the same philosophical
value; while even from the few quotations from his <i>Left
and Right Hand of Count Tolstóy</i>, which were given in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
a preceding chapter, it is easy to see which way his sympathies
go.</p>

<p>Of the other critics of the same tendencies I shall only
name <span class="smcap">Skabitchévskiy</span> (born 1838), the author of a very
well written history of modern Russian literature, already
mentioned in these pages; <span class="smcap">K. Arsénieff</span> (born 1837),
whose <i>Critical Studies</i> (1888) are the more interesting as
they deal at some length with some of the less known poets
and the younger contemporary writers; and <span class="smcap">P. Polevóy</span>
(1839-1903), the author of many historical novels and of
a popular and quite valuable <i>History of the Russian Literature</i>;
but I am compelled to pass over in silence the valuable
critical work done by <span class="smcap">Druzhínin</span> (1824-1864) after the
death of Byelínskiy, as also <span class="smcap">A. Grigórieff</span> (1822-1864),
a brilliant and original critic from the Slavophile camp. They
both took the “æsthetical” point of view and combated the
utilitarian views upon Art, but had no great success.</p>

<h3>TOLSTÓY’S “WHAT IS ART?”</h3>

<p>It is thus seen that for the last eighty years, beginning
with Venevítinoff and Nadézhdin, Russian art-critics have
worked to establish the idea that art has a <i>raison d’être</i> only
when it is “in the service of society” and contributes
towards raising society to higher humanitarian conceptions—by
those means which are proper to art, and distinguish
it from science. This idea which so much shocked Western
readers when Proudhon developed it has been advocated
in Russia by all those who have exercised a real influence
upon critical judgment in art matters. And they were supported
<i>de facto</i> by some of our greatest poets, such as
Lérmontoff and Turguéneff. As to the critics of the other
camp, like Druzhínin, Annenkoff and A. Grigórieff, who
took either the opposite view of “art for art’s sake,” or
some intermediate view—who preached that the criterium
of art is “The Beautiful” and clung to the theories of the
German æsthetical writers—they have had no hold upon
Russian thought.</p>

<p>The metaphysics of the German æsthetical writers was
more than once demolished in the opinion of Russian readers—especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
by Byelínskiy, in his <i>Review of Literature for
1847</i>, and by Tchernyshévskiy in his <i>Æsthetic Relations of
Art to Reality</i>. In this <i>Review</i> Byelínskiy fully developed
his ideas concerning Art in the service of mankind, and
proved that although Art is not identical with Science, and
differs from it by the way it treats the facts of life, it nevertheless
has with it a common <i>aim</i>. The man of science <i>demonstrates</i>—the
poet <i>shows</i>; but both <i>convince</i>; the one by his
arguments, the other—by his scenes from life. The same was
done by Tchernyshévskiy when he maintained that the aim
of Art is not unlike that of History: that it <i>explains to us life</i>,
and that consequently Art which should merely reproduce
facts of life without adding to our compensation of it
would not be Art at all.</p>

<p>These few remarks will explain why Tolstóy’s <i>What is
Art?</i> produced much less impression in Russia than abroad.
What struck us in it was not its leading idea, which was
quite familiar to us, but the fact that the great artist also
made it his own, and was supporting it by all the weight
of his artistic experience; and then, of course, the literary
form he gave the idea. Moreover, we read with the greatest
interest his witty criticisms of both the “decadent” would-be
poets and the librettos of Wagner’s operas; to which latter,
let me add by the way, Wagner wrote, in places, wonderfully
beautiful music, as soon as he came to deal with the universal
<i>human passions</i>,—love, compassion, envy, the joy of life,
and so on, and forgot all about his fairy-tale background.</p>

<p><i>What is Art?</i> offered the more interest in Russia because
the defenders of pure Art and the haters of the “nihilists
in Art” had been accustomed to quote Tolstóy as of their
camp. In his youth indeed he seems not to have had very
definite ideas about Art. At any rate, when, in 1859, he was
received as a member of the Society of Friends of Russian
Literature, he pronounced a speech on the necessity of <i>not</i>
dragging Art into the smaller disputes of the day, to which
the Slavophile Homyakóff replied in a fiery speech, contesting
his ideas with great energy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are moments—great historic moments”—Homyakóff
said—“when self-denunciation (he meant on the part of Society)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
has especial, incontestable rights.... The ‘accidental’ and the
‘temporary’ in the historical development of a nation’s life acquire
then the meaning of the universal and the broadly human, because
all generations and all nations can understand, and do understand,
the painful moans and the painful confessions of a given generation
or a given nation.” ... “An artist”—he continued—“is not
a theory; he is not a mere domain of thought and cerebral activity.
He is a man—always a man of his own time—usually one of its best
representatives.... Owing to the very impressionability of his
organism, without which he would not have been an artist, he, more
than the others, receives both the painful and the pleasant impressions
of the Society in the midst of which he was born.”</p>
</div>

<p>Showing that Tolstóy had already taken just this standpoint
in some of his works; for example, in describing the
death of the horse-driver in <i>Three Deaths</i>, Homyakóff concluded
by saying: “Yes, you have been, and you will be one
of those who denounce the evils of Society. Continue to
follow the excellent way you have chosen.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, in <i>What is Art?</i> Tolstóy entirely breaks with
the theories of “Art for Art’s sake,” and makes an open
stand by the side of those whose ideas have been expounded
in the preceding pages. He only defines still more correctly
the domain of Art when he says that the artist always aims
at communicating to others the same feelings which he
experiences at the sight of nature or of human life. Not to
<i>convince</i>, as Tchernyshévskiy said, but to <i>infect</i> the others
with his own <i>feelings</i>, which is certainly more correct. However,
“feeling” and “thought” are inseparable. A feeling
seeks words to express itself, and a feeling expressed in words
is a thought. And when Tolstóy says that the aim of artistic
activity is to transmit “the highest feelings which humanity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
has attained” and that Art must be “religious”—that is,
wake up the highest and the best aspirations—he only
expresses in other words what all our best critics since Venevítinoff,
Nadézhdin and Polevóy have said. In fact, when he
complains that nobody teaches men <i>how to live</i>, he overlooks
that that is precisely what good Art is doing, and what our
art-critics have always done. Byelínskiy, Dobrolúboff and
Písareff, and their continuators have done nothing but <i>to
teach men how to live</i>. They studied and analysed life, as
it had been understood by the greatest artists of each century,
and they drew from their works conclusions as to “how
to live.”</p>

<p>More than this. When Tolstóy, armed with his powerful
criticism, chastises what he so well describes as “counterfeits
of Art,” he continues the work that Tchernyshévskiy,
Dobrolúboff and especially Písareff had done. He sides with
Bazároff. Only, this intervention of the great artist gives a
more deadly blow to the “Art for Art’s sake” theory still
in vogue in Western Europe than anything that Proudhon
or our Russian critics, unknown in the West, could possibly
have done.</p>

<p>As to Tolstóy’s idea concerning the value of a work of
Art being measured by its accessibility to the great number,
which has been so fiercely attacked on all sides, and even
ridiculed—this assertion, although it has perhaps not yet
been very well expressed, contains, I believe, the germs of a
great idea which sooner or later is certain to make its way.
It is evident that every form of art has a certain conventional
way of expressing itself—its own way of “infecting
others with the artist’s feelings,” and therefore requires a
certain training to understand it. Tolstóy is hardly right in
overlooking the fact that some training is required for rightly
comprehending even the simplest forms of art, and his
criterion of “universal understanding” seems therefore far-fetched.</p>

<p>However, there lies in what he says a deep idea. Tolstóy
is certainly right in asking why the Bible has not yet been
superseded, as a work of Art accessible to everyone. Michelet
had already made a similar remark, and had said that what
was wanted by our century was <i>Le Livre, The Book</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
shall contain in a great, poetical form accessible to all, the
embodiment of nature with all her glories and of the history
of all mankind in its deepest human features. Humboldt
had aimed at this in his <i>Cosmos</i>; but grand though his work
is, it is accessible to only the very few. It was not he who
should transfigure science into poetry. And we have no work
of Art which even approaches this need of modern mankind.</p>

<p>The reason is self-evident: <i>Because Art has become too
artificial</i>; because, being chiefly for the rich, it has too much
specialised its ways of expression, so as to be understood
by the few only. In this respect Tolstóy is absolutely right.
Take the mass of excellent works that have been mentioned
in this book. How very few of them will ever become accessible
to a large public! The fact is, that a new Art is indeed
required. And it will come when the artist, having understood
this idea of Tolstóy’s, shall say to himself: “I may
write highly philosophical works of art in which I depict
the inner drama of the highly educated and refined man of
our own times; I may write works which contain the highest
poetry of nature, involving a deep knowledge and comprehension
of the life of nature; but, if I can write such
things, I must also be able, if I am a true artist, to speak
to all: to write other things which will be as deep in conception
as these, but which everyone, including the humblest
miner or peasant, will be able to understand and enjoy!”
To say that a folk-song is <i>greater</i> Art than a Beethoven
sonata is not correct: we cannot compare a storm in the
Alps, and the struggle against it, with a fine, quiet mid-summer
day and hay-making. But truly great Art, which,
notwithstanding its depth and its lofty flight, will penetrate
into every peasant’s hut and inspire everyone with higher
conceptions of thought and life—such an Art is really
wanted.</p>

<h3>SOME CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTS</h3>

<p>It does not enter into the plan of this book to analyse
contemporary Russian writers. Another volume would be
required to do them justice, not only on account of the
literary importance of some of them, and the interest of
the various directions in Art which they represent, but
especially because in order to properly explain the character
of the present literature, and the different currents in
Russian Art, it would be necessary to enter into many details
concerning the unsettled conditions under which the country
has been living during the last thirty years. Moreover, most
of the contemporary writers have not yet said their last
word, and we can expect from them works of even greater
value than any they have hitherto produced. I am compelled,
therefore, to limit myself to brief remarks concerning the
most prominent living novelists of the present day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oertel</span> (born 1855) has unfortunately abandoned literature
during the last few years, just at a time when his last
novel, <i>Smyéna</i> (<i>Changing Guards</i>), had given proofs of a
further development of his sympathetic talent. He was born
in the borderland of the Russian Steppes, and was brought
up on one of the large estates of this region. Later on he
went to the university of St. Petersburg and, as a matter of
fact, was compelled to leave it after some “students’ disorders,”
and was interned in the town of Tver. He soon
returned, however, to his native Steppe region, which he
cherishes with the same love as Nikítin and Koltsóff.</p>

<p>Oertel began his literary career by short sketches which
are now collected in two volumes under the name of <i>Notebook
of a Prairie-Man</i>, and whose manner suggests Turguéneff’s
<i>Sportsman’s Notebook</i>. The nature of the prairies
is admirably described in these little stories, with great
warmth and poetry, and the types of peasants who appear
in the stories are perfectly true to nature, without any
attempts at idealisation, although one feels that the author
is no great admirer of the “intellectuals” and fully appreciates
the general ethics of rural life. Some of these sketches,
especially those which deal with the growing <i>bourgeoisie du
village</i>, are highly artistic. <i>Two Couples</i> (1887), in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the parallel stories of two young couples in love—one of
educated people and the other of peasants—are given, is a
story evidently written under the influence of the ideas of
Tolstóy, and bearing traces of a preconceived idea, which
spoils in places the artistic value of the novel. There are
nevertheless admirable scenes, testifying to very fine powers
of observation.</p>

<p>However, the real force of Oertel is not in discussing
psychological problems. His true domain is the description
of whole regions, with all the variety of types of men
which one finds amidst the mixed populations of South
Russia, and this force appears at its best in <i>The Gardénins,
their Retainers, their Followers, and their Enemies</i>, and in
<i>Changing Guards</i>. Russian critics have, of course, very seriously
and very minutely discussed the young heroes, Efrem
and Nicholas, who appear in <i>The Gardénins</i>, and they have
made a rigorous inquiry into the ways of thinking of these
young men. But this is of a quite secondary importance, and
one almost regrets that the author, paying a tribute to his
times, has given the two young men more attention than they
deserve, being only two more individuals in the great picture
of country life which he has drawn for us. The fact is, that
just as we have in Gógol’s tales quite a world opening before
us—a Little Russian village, or provincial life—so also here
we see, as the very title of the novel suggests, the whole life
of a large estate at the times of serfdom, with its mass of
retainers, followers and foes, all grouped round the horse-breeding
establishment which makes the fame of the estate
and the pride of all connected with it. It is the life of that
crowd of people, the life at the horse-fairs and the races, not
the discussions or the loves of a couple of young men, which
makes the main interest of the picture; and that life is really
reproduced in as masterly a manner as it is in a good Dutch
picture representing some village fair. No writer in Russia
since Serghéi Aksákoff and Gógol has so well succeeded in
painting a whole corner of Russia with its scores of figures,
all living and all placed in those positions of relative importance
which they occupy in real life.</p>

<p>The same power is felt in <i>Changing Guards</i>. The subject
of this novel is very interesting. It shows how the old noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
families disintegrate, like their estates, and how another
class of men—merchants and unscrupulous adventurers—get
possession of these estates, while a new class made up of the
younger merchants and clerks, who are beginning to be
inspired with some ideas of freedom and higher culture, constitutes
already the germ of a new stratum of the educated
classes. In this novel, too, some critics fastened their attention
chiefly on the undoubtedly interesting types of the
aristocratic girl, the Non-conformist peasant whom she
begins to love, the practical Radical young merchant—all
painted quite true to life; but they overlooked what makes
the real importance of the novel. Here again we have quite
a region of South Russia (as typical as the Far West is in
the United States), throbbing with life and full of living
men and women, as it was some twenty years after the liberation
of the serfs, when a new life, not devoid of some
American features, was beginning to appear. The contrast
between this young life and the decaying mansion is very
well reproduced, too. In the romances of the young people—the
whole bearing the stamp of the most sympathetic individuality
of the author.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Korolénko</span> was born (in 1853) in a small town of Western
Russia, and there he received his first education. In
1872 he was at the Agricultural Academy of Moscow, but
was compelled to leave after having taken part in some
students’ movement. Later on he was arrested as a “political,”
and exiled, first to a small town of the Uráls, and then
to Western Siberia, and from there, after his refusal to
take the oath of allegiance to Alexander III., he was transported
to a Yakút encampment several hundred miles beyond
Yakútsk. There he spent several years, and when he returned
to Russia in 1886, not being allowed to stay in University
towns, he settled at Nízhniy Nóvgorod.</p>

<p>Life in the far north, in the deserts of Yakútsk, in a small
encampment buried for half the year in the snow, produced
upon Korolénko an extremely deep impression, and the little
stories which he wrote about Siberian subjects (<i>The Dream
of Makár</i>, <i>The Man from Sakhalín</i>, etc.), were so beautiful
that he was unanimously recognised as a true heir to Turguéneff.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
There is in the little stories of Korolénko a force,
a sense of proportion, a mastery in depicting the characters,
and an artistic finish, which not only distinguish him from
most of his young contemporaries, but reveal in him a true
artist. <i>What the Forest Says</i>, in which he related a dramatic
episode from serfdom times in Lithuania, only further confirmed
the high reputation which Korolénko had already
won. It is not an imitation of Turguéneff, and yet it at
once recalled, by its comprehension of the life of the
forest, the great novelist’s beautiful sketch, <i>The Woodlands</i>
(<i>Polyesie</i>). <i>In Bad Society</i> is evidently taken from the
author’s childhood, and this idyll among tramps and thieves
who concealed themselves in the ruins of some tower is of
such beauty, especially in the scenes with children, that
everyone found in it a truly “Turguéneff charm.” But then
Korolénko came to a halt. His <i>Blind Musician</i> was read in
all languages, and admired—again for its charm; but it was
felt that the over-refined psychology of this novel is hardly
correct; and no greater production worthy of the extremely
sympathetic and rich talent of Korolénko has appeared since,
while his attempts at producing a larger and more elaborate
romance were not crowned with success.</p>

<p>This is somewhat striking, but the same would have to
be said of all the contemporaries of Korolénko, among whom
there are men and women of great talent. To analyse the
causes of this fact, especially with reference to so great an
artist as Korolénko, would certainly be a tempting task. But
this would require speaking at some length of the change
which took place in the Russian novel during the last twenty
years or so, in connection with the political life of the country.
A few hints will perhaps explain what is meant. In the
seventies quite a special sort of novel had been created by a
number of young novelists—mostly contributors of the
review, <i>Rússkoye Slóvo</i>. The “thoughtful realist”—such as
he was understood by Písareff—was their hero, and however
imperfect the technique of these novels might have been in
some cases, their leading idea was most honest, and the
influence they exercised upon Russian youth was in the right
direction. This was the time when Russian women were
making their first steps towards higher education, and trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
to conquer some sort of economical and intellectual independence.
To attain this, they had to sustain a bitter struggle
against their elders. “Madame Kabanóva” and “Dikóy”
(see Ch. VI.) were alive then in a thousand guises, in all
classes of society, and our women had to struggle hard
against their parents and relatives, who did not understand
their children; against “Society” as a whole, which hated
the “emancipated woman”; and against the Government,
which only too well foresaw the dangers that a new generation
of educated women would represent for an autocratic
bureaucracy. It was of the first necessity, then, that at least
in the men of the same generation the young fighters for
women’s rights should find helpers, and not that sort of
men about whom Turguéneff’s heroine in <i>Correspondence</i>
wrote (see Ch. IV.). In this direction—especially after the
splendid beginning that was made by two women writers,
<span class="smcap">Sophie Smirnóva</span> (<i>The Little Fire</i>, <i>The Salt of the Earth</i>)
and <span class="smcap">Olga Shapír</span>—our men-novelists have done good service,
both in maintaining the energy of women in their hard
struggle and in inspiring men with respect towards that
struggle and those who fought in it.</p>

<p>Later on a new element became prominent in the Russian
novel. It was the “populist” element—love to the
masses of toilers, work among them in order to introduce,
be it the slightest spark of light and hope, into their sad
existence. Again the novel contributed immensely to maintain
that movement and to inspire men and women in that sort
of work, an instance of which has been given on a preceding
page, in speaking of <i>The Great Bear</i>. The workers in both
these fields were numerous, and I can only name in passing
<span class="smcap">Mordóvtseff</span> (in <i>Signs of the Times</i>), <span class="smcap">Scheller</span>, who
wrote under the name of <span class="smcap">A. Mikháiloff</span>, <span class="smcap">Stanukóvitch</span>,
<span class="smcap">Novodvórskiy</span>, <span class="smcap">Barantsévitch</span>, <span class="smcap">Matchtétt</span>, <span class="smcap">Mámin</span>,
and the poet, <span class="smcap">Nádson</span>, who all, either directly or indirectly,
worked through the novel and poetry in the same direction.</p>

<p>However, the struggle for liberty which was begun about
1857, after having reached its culminating point in 1881,
came to a temporary end, and for the next ten years a complete
prostration spread amidst the Russian “intellectuals.”
Faith in the old ideals and the old inspiring watchwords—even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
faith in men—was passing away, and new tendencies
began to make their way in Art—partly under the influence
of this phase of the Russian movement, and partly also under
the influence of Western Europe. A sense of fatigue became
evident. Faith in knowledge was shaken. Social ideals were
relegated to the background. “Rigourism” was condemned,
and “popularism” began to be represented as ludicrous, or,
when it reappeared, it was in some religious form, as Tolstóyism.
Instead of the former enthusiasm for “mankind,”
the “rights of the individual” were proclaimed, which
“rights” did not mean equal rights for all, but the rights
of the few over all the others.</p>

<p>In these unsettled conditions of social ideas our younger
novelists—always anxious to reflect in their art the questions
of the day—have had to develop; and this confusion
necessarily stands in the way of their producing anything
as definite and as complete as did their predecessors of the
previous generation. There have been no such complete individualities
in society; and a true artist is incapable of
inventing what does not exist.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Dmitriy Merezhkóvskiy</span> (born 1866) may be taken to
illustrate the difficulties which a writer, even when endowed
with a by no means ordinary talent, found in reaching his
full development under the social and political conditions
which prevailed in Russia during the period just mentioned.
Leaving aside his poetry—although it is also very characteristic—and
taking only his novels and critical articles, we see
how, after having started with a certain sympathy, or at least
with a certain respect, for those Russian writers of the previous
generation who wrote under the inspiration of higher
social ideals, Merezhkóvskiy gradually began to suspect these
ideals, and finally ended by treating them with contempt.
He found that they were of no avail, and he began to speak
more and more of “the sovereign rights of the individual,”
but not in the sense in which they were understood by Godwin
and other eighteenth century philosophers, nor in the sense
which Písareff attributed to them when he spoke of the
“thoughtful realist”; Merezkhóvskiy took them in the
sense—desperately vague, and narrow when not vague—attributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
to them by Nietzsche. At the same time he began
to speak more and more of “Beauty” and “the worship of
the Beautiful,” but again not in the sense which idealists
attributed to such words, but in the limited, erotic sense in
which “Beauty” was understood by the “Æsthetics” of
the leisured class in the forties.</p>

<p>The main work which Merezhkóvskiy undertook offered
great interest. He began a trilogy of novels in which he
intended to represent the struggle of the antique pagan world
against Christianity: on the one hand, the Hellenic love and
poetic comprehension of nature, and its worship of sound,
exuberant life; and on the other, the life-depressing influences
of Judaic Christianity, with its condemnation of the
study of nature, of poetry, art, pleasure, and sound, healthy
life altogether. The first novel of the trilogy was <i>Julian the
Apostate</i>, and the second, <i>Leonardo da Vinci</i> (both have
been translated into English). They were the result of a
careful study of the antique Greek world and the Renaissance,
and notwithstanding some defects (absence of real
feeling, even in the glorification of the worship of Beauty,
and a certain abuse of archæological details), both contained
really beautiful and impressive scenes; while the fundamental
idea—the necessity of a synthesis between the poetry of
nature of the antique world and the higher humanising
ideals of Christianity—was forcibly impressed upon the
reader.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Merezhkóvskiy’s admiration of antique
“Naturism” did not last. He had not yet written the third
novel of his trilogy when modern “Symbolism” began to
penetrate into his works, with the result that notwithstanding
all his abilities the young author seems now to be drifting
straight towards a hopeless mysticism, like that into
which Gógol fell towards the end of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It may seem strange to the West Europeans, and especially
to English readers, to hear of such a rapid succession of
different moods of thought in Russian society, sufficiently
deep to exercise such an influence upon the novels as has just
been mentioned. And yet so it is, in consequence of the historical
phase which Russia is living through. There is even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
a very gifted novelist, <span class="smcap">Boborýkin</span> (born 1836), who has
made it his peculiar work to describe in novels the prevailing
moods of Russian educated society in their rapid succession
for the last thirty years. The technique of his novels is always
excellent (he is also the author of a good critical work, just
published, on the influences of Western romance upon the
Russian novel). His observations are always correct; his
personal point of view is that of an honest advanced progressive;
and his novels can always be taken as true and good
pictures of the tendencies which prevailed at a given moment
amongst the Russian “intellectuals.” For the history of
thought in Russia they are simply invaluable; and they must
have helped many a young reader to find his or her way
amidst the various facts of life; but the variety of currents
which have been chronicled by Boborýkin would appear
simply puzzling to a Western reader.</p>

<p>Boborýkin has been reproached by some critics with not
having sufficiently distinguished between what was important
in the facts of life which he described and what was irrelevant
or only ephemeral, but this is hardly correct. The
main defect of his work lies perhaps elsewhere; namely, in
that the individuality of the author is hardly felt in it at
all. He seems to record the kaleidoscope of life without
living with his heroes, and without suffering or rejoicing
with them. He has noticed and perfectly well observed those
persons whom he describes; his judgment of them is that of
an intelligent, experienced man; but none of them has
impressed him enough to become part of himself. Therefore
they do not strike the reader with any sufficient depth of
impression.</p>

<p>One of our contemporary authors, also endowed with
great talent, who is publishing a simply stupefying quantity
of novels, is <span class="smcap">Potápenko</span>. He was born in 1856, in South
Russia, and after having studied music, he began writing in
1881, and although his later novels bear traces of too hasty
work, he still remains a favourite writer. Amidst the dark
colours which prevail now amongst the Russian novelists,
Potápenko is a happy exception. Some of his novels are full
of highly comic scenes, and compel the reader to laugh
heartily with the author. But even when there are no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
scenes, and the facts are, on the contrary, sad, or even
tragical, the effect of the novel is not depressing—perhaps
because the author never departs from his own point of
view of a satisfied optimist. In this respect Potápenko is
absolutely the opposite of most of his contemporaries, and
especially of Tchéhoff.</p>

<h3>A. P. TCHÉHOFF</h3>

<p>Of all the contemporary Russian novelists A. P. Tchéhoff
(1860-1904) was undoubtedly the most deeply original.
It was not a mere originality of style. His style, like that
of every great artist, bears of course the stamp of his personality;
but he never tried to strike his readers with some
style-effects of his own: he probably despised them, and
he wrote with the same simplicity as Púshkin, Turguéneff
and Tolstóy have written. Nor did he choose some special
contents for his tales and novels, or appropriate to himself
some special class of men. Few authors, on the contrary, have
dealt with so wide a range of men and women, taken from all
the layers, divisions and subdivisions of Russian society as
Tchéhoff did. And with all that, as Tolstóy has remarked,
Tchéhoff represents something of his own in art; he has
struck a new vein, not only for Russian literature, but for
literature altogether, and thus belongs to all nations. His
nearest relative is Guy de Maupassant, but a certain family
resemblance between the two writers exists only in a few of
their short stories. The manner of Tchéhoff, and especially
the mood in which all the sketches, the short novels, and the
dramas of Tchéhoff are written, are entirely his own. And
then, there is all the difference between the two writers which
exists between contemporary France and Russia at that
special period of development through which our country has
been passing lately.</p>

<p>The biography of Tchéhoff can be told in a few words. He
was born in 1860, in South Russia, at Taganróg. His father
was originally a serf, but he had apparently exceptional business
capacities, and freed himself early in his life. To his
son he gave a good education—first in the local gymnasium
(college), and later on at the university of Moscow. “I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
not know much about faculties at that time,” Tchéhoff
wrote once in a short biographical note, “and I don’t well
remember why I chose the medical faculty; but I never
regretted that choice later on.” He did not become a medical
practitioner; but a year’s work in a small village hospital
near Moscow, and similar work later on, when he volunteered
to stand at the head of a medical district during the
cholera epidemics of 1892, brought him into close contact
with a wide world of men and women of all sorts and characters;
and, as he himself has noticed, his acquaintance with
natural sciences and with the scientific method of thought
helped him a great deal in his subsequent literary work.</p>

<p>Tchéhoff began his literary career very early. Already
during the first years of his university studies—that is, in
1879, he began to write short humorous sketches (under the
pseudonym of Tcheónte) for some weeklies. His talent
developed rapidly; and the sympathy with which his first
little volumes of short sketches was met in the Press, and the
interest which the best Russian critics (especially Mikhailóvskiy)
took in the young novelist, must have helped him to
give a more serious turn to his creative genius. With every
year the problems of life which he treated were deeper and
more complicated, while the form he attained bore traces of
an increasingly fine artistic finish. When Tchéhoff died last
year, at the age of only forty-four, his talent had already
reached its full maturity. His last production—a drama—contained
such fine poetical touches, and such a mixture of
poetical melancholy with strivings towards the joy of a well-filled
life, that it would have seemed to open a new page in
his creation if it were not known that consumption was
rapidly undermining his life.</p>

<p>No one has ever succeeded, as Tchéhoff has, in representing
the failures of human nature in our present civilisation,
and especially the failure, the bankruptcy of the educated
man in the face of the all-invading meanness of everyday life.
This defeat of the “intellectual” he has rendered with a
wonderful force, variety, and impressiveness. And there lies
the distinctive feature of his talent.</p>

<p>When you read the sketches and the stories of Tchéhoff
in chronological succession, you see first an author full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
the most exuberant vitality and youthful fun. The stories
are, as a rule, very short; many of them cover only three or
four pages; but they are full of the most infecting merriment.
Some of them are mere farces; but you cannot help
laughing in the heartiest way, because even the most ludicrous
and impossible ones are written with an inimitable
charm. And then, gradually, amidst that same fun, comes a
touch of heartless vulgarity on the part of some of the actors
in the story, and you feel how the author’s heart throbs with
pain. Slowly, gradually, this note becomes more frequent; it
claims more and more attention; it ceases to be accidental, it
becomes organic—till at last, in every story, in every novel,
it stifles everything else. It may be the reckless heartlessness
of a young man who, “for fun,” will make a girl believe that
she is loved, or the heartlessness and absence of the most
ordinary humanitarian feeling in the family of an old professor—it
is always the same note of heartlessness and meanness
which resounds, the same absence of the more refined
human feelings, or, still worse—the complete intellectual and
moral bankruptcy of “the intellectual.”</p>

<p>Tchéhoff’s heroes are not people who have never heard
better words, or never conceived better ideas than those which
circulate in the lowest circles of the Philistines. No, they have
heard such words, and their hearts have beaten once upon a
time at the sound of such words. But the common-place everyday
life has stifled all such aspirations, apathy has taken its
place, and now there remains only a haphazard existence
amidst a hopeless meanness. The meanness which Tchéhoff
represents is the one which begins with the loss of faith in
one’s forces and the gradual loss of all those brighter hopes
and illusions which make the charm of all activity, and, then,
step by step, this meanness destroys the very springs of life:
broken hopes, broken hearts, broken energies. Man reaches
a stage when he can only mechanically repeat certain actions
from day to day, and goes to bed, happy if he has “killed”
his time in any way, gradually falling into a complete intellectual
apathy, and a moral indifference. The worst is that
the very multiplicity of samples which Tchéhoff gives, without
repeating himself, from so many different layers of
society, seems to tell the reader that it is the rottenness of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
whole civilisation, of an epoch, which the author divulges
to us.</p>

<p>Speaking of Tchéhoff, Tolstóy made the deep remark that
he was one of those few whose novels are willingly re-read
more than once. This is quite true. Every one of Tchéhoff’s
stories—it may be the smallest bagatelle or a small novel, or
it may be a drama—produces an impression which cannot
easily be forgotten. At the same time they contain such a profusion
of minute detail, admirably chosen so as to increase
the impression, that in re-reading them one always finds a
new pleasure. Tchéhoff was certainly a great artist. Besides,
the variety of the men and women of all classes which appear
in his stories, and the variety of psychological subjects dealt
in them, is simply astounding. And yet every story bears so
much the stamp of the author that in the most insignificant
of them you recognise Tchéhoff, with his proper individuality
and manner, with his conception of men and things.</p>

<p>Tchéhoff has never tried to write long novels or romances.
His domain is the short story, in which he excels. He certainly
never tries to give in it the whole history of his heroes from
their birth to the grave: this would not be the proper way in
a short story. He takes one moment only from that life, only
one episode. And he tells it in such a way that the reader forever
retains in memory the type of men or women represented;
so that, when later on he meets a living specimen of
that type, he exclaims: “But this is Tchéhoff’s Ivánoff, or
Tchéhoff’s Darling!” In the space of some twenty pages
and within the limitations of a single episode there is revealed
a complicated psychological drama—a world of mutual relations.
Take, for instance, the very short and impressive
sketch, <i>From a Doctor’s Practice</i>. It is a story in which
there is no story after all. A doctor is invited to see a girl,
whose mother is the owner of a large cotton mill. They live
there, in a mansion close to, and within the enclosure of, the
immense buildings. The girl is the only child, and is
worshipped by her mother. But she is not happy. Indefinite
thoughts worry her: she is stifled in that atmosphere. Her
mother is also unhappy on account of her darling’s unhappiness,
and the only happy creature in the household is the ex-governess
of the girl, now a sort of lady-companion, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
really enjoys the luxurious surroundings of the mansion and
its rich table. The doctor is asked to stay over the night, and
tells to his sleepless patient that she is not bound to stay
there: that a really well-intentioned person can find many
places in the world where she would find an activity to suit
her. And when the doctor leaves next morning the girl has
put on a white dress and has a flower in her hair. She looks
very earnest, and you guess that she meditates already about
a new start in her life. Within the limits of these few traits
quite a world of aimless philistine life has thus been unveiled
before your eyes, a world of factory life, and a world of new
longings making an irruption into it, and finding support
from the outside. You read all this in the little episode. You
see with a striking distinctness the four main personages upon
whom light has been focused for a short moment. And in
the hazy outlines which you rather guess than see on the
picture round the brightly lighted spot, you discover quite a
world of complicated human relations, at the present moment
and in times to come. Take away anything of the distinctness
of the figures in the lighted spot, or anything of the haziness
of the remainder—and the picture will be spoiled.</p>

<p>Such are nearly all the stories of Tchéhoff. Even when
they cover some fifty pages they have the same character.</p>

<p>Tchéhoff wrote a couple of stories from peasant life. But
peasants and village life are not his proper sphere. His true
domain is the world of the “intellectuals”—the educated
and the half-educated portion of Russian society—and these
he knows in perfection. He shows their bankruptcy, their
inaptitude to solve the great historical problem of renovation
which fell upon them, and the meanness and vulgarity of
everyday life under which an immense number of them succumb.
Since the times of Gógol no writer in Russia has so
wonderfully represented human meanness under its varied
aspects. And yet, what a difference between the two! Gógol
took mainly the outer meanness, which strikes the eye and
often degenerates into farce, and therefore in most cases
brings a smile on your lips or makes you laugh. But laughter
is always a step towards reconciliation. Tchéhoff also makes
you laugh in his earlier productions, but in proportion as he
advances in age, and looks more seriously upon life, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
laughter disappears, and although a fine humour remains,
you feel that he now deals with a kind of meanness and
philistinism which provokes, not smiles but suffering in the
author. A “Tchéhoff sorrow” is as much characteristic of his
writings as the deep furrow between the brows of his lively
eyes is characteristic of his good-natured face. Moreover, the
meanness which Tchéhoff depicts is much deeper than the
one which Gógol knew. Deeper conflicts are now going on in
the depths of the modern educated men, of which Gógol
knew nothing seventy years ago. The “sorrow” of Tchéhoff
is also that of a much more sensitive and a more refined
nature than the “unseen tears” of Gógol’s satire.</p>

<p>Better than any Russian novelist, Tchéhoff understands
the fundamental vice of that mass of Russian “intellectuals,”
who very well <i>see</i> the dark sides of Russian life but have no
force to join that small minority of younger people who dare
to rebel against the evil. In this respect, only one more writer—and
this one was a woman, Hvóschinskaya (“Krestóvskiy-pseudonyme”),
who can be placed by the side of Tchéhoff.
He knew, and more than knew—he felt with every nerve of
his poetical mind—that, apart from a handful of stronger
men and women, the true curse of the Russian “intellectual”
is the weakness of his will, the insufficient strength of his
desires. Perhaps he felt it in himself. And when he was asked
once (in 1894) in a letter—“What should a Russian desire at
the present time?” he wrote in return: “Here is my reply:
desire! He needs most of all desire—force of character. We
have enough of that whining shapelessness.”</p>

<p>This absence of strong desire and weakness of will he
continually, over and over again, represented in his heroes.
But this predilection was not a mere accident of temperament
and character. It was a direct product of the times he
lived in.</p>

<p>Tchéhoff, we saw, was nineteen years old when he began
to write in 1879. He thus belongs to the generation which
had to live through, during their best years, the worst years
which Russia has passed through in the second half of the
nineteenth century. With the tragic death of Alexander II.
and the advent to the throne of his son, Alexander III., a
whole epoch—the epoch of progressive work and bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
hopes had come to a final close. All the sublime efforts of that
younger generation which had entered the political arena in
the seventies, and had taken for its watchword the symbol:
“Be with the people!” had ended in a crushing defeat—the
victims moaning now in fortresses and in the snows of
Siberia. More than that, all the great reforms, including the
abolition of serfdom, which had been realised in the sixties
by the Hérzen, Turguéneff, and Tchernyshévskiy generation,
began now to be treated as so many mistakes, by the reactionary
elements which had now rallied round Alexander III.
Never will a Westerner understand the depth of despair and
the hopeless sadness which took hold of the intellectual portion
of Russian society for the next ten or twelve years after
that double defeat, when it came to the conclusion that it was
incapable to break the inertia of the masses, or to move
history so as to fill up the gap between its high ideals and
the heartrending reality. In this respect “the eighties” were
perhaps the gloomiest period that Russia lived through for
the last hundred years. In the fifties the intellectuals had at
least full hope in their forces; now—they had lost even these
hopes. It was during those very years that Tchéhoff began to
write; and, being a true poet, who feels and responds to the
moods of the moment, he became the painter of that breakdown—of
that failure of the “intellectuals” which hung as
a nightmare above the civilised portion of Russian society.
And again, being a great poet, he depicted that all-invading
philistine meanness in such features that his picture will live.
How superficial, in comparison, is the philistinism described
by Zola. Perhaps, France even does not know that disease
which was gnawing then at the very marrow of the bones
of the Russian “intellectual.”</p>

<p>With all that, Tchéhoff is by no means a pessimist in the
proper sense of the word; if he had come to despair, he
would have taken the bankruptcy of the “intellectuals” as
a necessary fatality. A word, such as, for instance, “<i>fin de
siècle</i>,” would have been his solace. But Tchéhoff could not
find satisfaction in such words because he firmly believed that
a better existence was possible—and would come. “From
my childhood”—he wrote in an intimate letter—“I have
believed in progress, because the difference between the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
when they used to flog me, and when they stopped to do so
[in the sixties] was tremendous.”</p>

<p>There are three dramas of Tchéhoff—<i>Ivánoff</i>, <i>Uncle
Ványa</i> (<i>Uncle John</i>), and <i>The Cherry-Tree Garden</i>, which
fully illustrate how his faith in a better future grew in him as
he advanced in age. Ivánoff, the hero of the first drama, is
the personification of that failure of the “intellectual” of
which I just spoke. Once upon a time he had had his high
ideals and he still speaks of them, and this is why Sásha, a
girl, full of the better inspirations—one of those fine intellectual
types in the representation of which Tchéhoff appears
as a true heir of Turguéneff—falls in love with him. But
Ivánoff knows himself that he is played out; that the girl
loves in him what he is no more; that the sacred fire is with
him a mere reminiscence of the better years, irretrievably
past; and while the drama attains its culminating point, just
when his marriage with Sásha is going to be celebrated,
Ivánoff shoots himself. Pessimism is triumphant.</p>

<p><i>Uncle Ványa</i> ends also in the most depressing way; but
there is some faint hope in it. The drama reveals an even still
more complete breakdown of the educated “intellectual,” and
especially of the main representative of that class—the professor,
the little god of the family, for whom all others have
been sacrificing themselves, but who all his life has only
written beautiful words about the sacred problems of art,
while all his life he remained the most perfect egotist. But
the end of this drama is different. The girl, Sónya, who is the
counterpart of Sásha, and has been one of those who sacrificed
themselves for the professor, remains more or less in
the background of the drama, until, at its very end she comes
forward in a halo of endless love. She is neglected by the
man whom she loves. This man—an enthusiast—prefers,
however, a beautiful woman (the second wife of the professor)
to Sónya, who is only one of those workers who bring
life into the darkness of Russian village life, by helping the
dark mass to pull through the hardships of their lives.</p>

<p>The drama ends in a heart-rending musical accord of devotion
and self-sacrifice on behalf of Sónya and her uncle. “It
cannot be helped”—Sónya says—“we must live! Uncle John,
we shall live. We shall live through a long succession of days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
and of long nights; we shall patiently bear the sufferings
which fate will send upon us; we shall work for the others—now,
and later on, in old age, knowing no rest; and when our
hour shall have come, we shall die without murmur, and
there, beyond the grave * * * we shall rest!”</p>

<p>There is, after all, a redeeming feature in that despair.
There remains the faith of Sónya in her capacity to work,
her readiness to face the work, even without personal
happiness.</p>

<p>But in proportion as Russian life becomes less gloomy;
in proportion as hopes of a better future for our country
begin to bud once more in the youthful beginnings of a movement
amongst the working classes in the industrial centres,
to the call of which the educated youth answer immediately;
in proportion as the “intellectuals” revive again, ready to
sacrifice themselves in order to conquer freedom for the
grand whole—the Russian people—Tchéhoff also begins to
look into the future with hope and optimism. <i>The Cherry-Tree
Garden</i> was his last swan-song, and the last words of
this drama sound a note full of hope in a better future. The
cherry-tree garden of a noble landlord, which used to be a
true fairy garden when the trees were in full bloom, and
nightingales sang in their thickets, has been pitilessly cut
down by the money-making middle class man. No blossom,
no nightingales—only dollars instead. But Tchéhoff looks
further into the future: he sees the place again in new hands,
and a new garden is going to grow instead of the old one—a
garden where all will find a new happiness in new surroundings.
Those whose whole life was for themselves alone
could never grow such a garden; but some day soon this will
be done by beings like Anya, the heroine, and her friend,
“the perpetual student”....</p>

<p>The influence of Tchéhoff, as Tolstóy has remarked, will
last, and will not be limited to Russia only. He has given
such a prominence to the short story and its ways of dealing
with human life that he has thus become a reformer of our
literary forms. In Russia he has already a number of imitators
who look upon him as upon the head of a school; but—will
they have also the same inimitable poetical feeling, the
same charming intimacy in the way of telling the stories, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
special form of love of nature, and above all, the beauty of
Tchéhoff’s smile amidst his tears?—all qualities inseparable
from his personality.</p>

<p>As to his dramas, they are favourites on the Russian stage,
both in the capitals and in the provinces. They are admirable
for the stage and produce a deep effect; and when they are
played by such a superior cast as that of the Artistic Theatre
at Moscow—as the <i>Cherry-Tree Garden</i> was played lately—they
become dramatic events.</p>

<p>In Russia Tchéhoff is now perhaps the most popular of
the younger writers. Speaking of the living novelists only,
he is placed immediately after Tolstóy, and his works are
read immensely. Separate volumes of his stories, published
under different titles—<i>In Twilight</i>, <i>Sad People</i> and so on—ran
each through ten to fourteen editions, while full
editions of Tchéhoff’s <i>Works</i> in ten and fourteen volumes,
sold in fabulous numbers: of the latter, which was given as
a supplement to a weekly, more than 200,000 copies were
circulated in one single year.</p>

<p>In Germany Tchéhoff has produced a deep impression;
his best stories have been translated more than once, so that
one of the leading Berlin critics exclaimed lately: “Tschéchoff,
Tschéchoff, und kein Ende!” (Tchéhoff, Tchéhoff, and no
end.) In Italy he begins to be widely read. And yet it is
only his stories which are known beyond Russia. His dramas
seem to be too “Russian,” and they hardly can deeply move
audiences outside the borders of Russia, where such dramas
of inner contradiction are not a characteristic feature of the
moment.</p>

<p>If there is any logic in the evolution of societies, such a
writer as Tchéhoff had to appear before literature could take
a new direction and produce the new types which already are
budding in life. At any rate, an impressive parting word had
to be pronounced, and this is what Tchéhoff has done.</p>

<h3 id="12n">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h3>

<p>While this book was being prepared for print a work of
great value for all the English-speaking lovers of Russian
literature appeared in America. I mean the <i>Anthology of
Russian Literature from the earliest Period to the present
Time</i>, by Leo Wiener, assistant professor of Slavic languages
at Harvard University, published in two stately volumes by
Messrs. Putnam’s Sons at New York. The first volume (400
pages) contains a rich selection from the earliest documents
of Russian literature—the annals, the epic songs, the lyric
folk-songs, etc., as also from the writers of the seventeenth
and the eighteenth centuries. It contains, moreover, a general
short sketch of the literature of the period and a mention is
made of all the English translations from the early Russian
literature. The second volume (500 pages) contains abstracts,
with short introductory notes and a full bibliography,
from all the chief authors of the nineteenth century, beginning
with Karamzín and ending with Tchéhoff, Górkiy, and
Merezhkóvskiy. All this has been done with full knowledge
of Russian literature and of every author; the choice of characteristic
abstracts hardly could be better, and the many
translations which Mr. Wiener himself has made are very
good. In this volume, too, all the English translations of
Russian authors are mentioned, and we must hope that their
number will now rapidly increase. Very many of the Russian
authors have hardly been translated at all, and in such cases
there is nothing else left but to advise the reader to peruse
French or German translations. Both are much more numerous
than the English, a considerable number of the
German translations being embodied in the cheap editions of
Reklam.</p>

<p>A work concerning Malo-Russian (Little-Russian) literature,
on lines similar to those followed by Mr. Wiener, has
appeared lately under the title, <i>Vik; the Century, a Collection
of Malo-Russian Poetry and Prose published from
1708 to 1898</i>, 3 vols. (Kiev, Peter Barski); (analysed in
<i>Athenæum</i>, January 10, 1903.)</p>

<p>Of general works which may be helpful to the student
of Russian literature I shall name Ralston’s <i>Early Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
History</i>, <i>Songs of the Russian People</i>, and <i>Russian Folk
Tales</i> (1872-1874), as also his translation of Afanásieff’s
<i>Legends</i>; Rambaud’s <i>La Russie épique</i> (1876) and his
excellent <i>History of Russia</i> (Engl. trans.); <i>Le roman russe</i>,
by Voguë; <i>Impressions of Russia</i>, by George Brandes (translated
by Eastman; Boston, 1889), and his <i>Moderne Geister</i>,
which contains an admirable chapter on Turguéneff.</p>

<p>Of general works in Russian, the following may be named:
<i>History of Russian Literature in Biographies and Sketches</i>,
by P. Polevóy, 2 vols., illustrated (1883; new edition,
enlarged, in 1903); and <i>History of the New Russian Literature
from 1848 to 1898</i>, by A. Skabitchévskiy, 4th ed., 1900,
with 52 portraits. Both are reliable, well written, and not
bulky works—the former being rather popular in character,
while the second is a critical work which goes into the
analysis of every writer. The recently published <i>Gallery of
Russian Writers</i>, edited by I. Ignátoff (Moscow, 1901),
contains over 250 good portraits of Russian authors, accompanied
by one page notices, quite well written, of their work.
A very exhaustive work is <i>History of the Russian Literature</i>
by A. Pýpin, in 4 vols., (1889), beginning with the earliest
times and ending with Púshkin, Lérmontoff, Gógol, and
Koltsóff. The same author has written a <i>History of Russian
Ethnography</i>, also in 4 vols. Among works dealing with portions
only of the Russian literature the following may be
mentioned: Tchernyshévskiy’s <i>Critical Articles</i>, St. Petersburg,
1893; Annenkoff’s <i>Púshkin and His Time</i>; O. Miller’s
<i>Russian Writers after Gógol</i>; Merezhkóvskiy’s books on
Púshkin and another on Tolstóy; and Arsénieff’s <i>Critical
Studies of Russian Literature</i>, 2 vols., 1888 (mentioned in
the text); and above all, of course, the collections of <i>Works</i>
of our critics: Byelínskiy (12 vols.); Dobrolúboff (4 vols.),
Písareff (6 vols.), and Mihailóvskiy (6 vols.), completed
by his <i>Literary Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<p>A work of very great value, which is still in progress, is
the <i>Biographic Dictionary of Russian Writers</i>, published and
nearly entirely written by S. Venguéroff, who is also the
editor of new, scientifically prepared editions of the complete
works of several authors (Byelínskiy is now published).
Excellent biographies and critical sketches of all Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
writers will be found in the <i>Russian Encyclopædia Dictionary</i>
of Brockhaus-Efron. The first two volumes of this Dictionary
(they will be completed in an Appendix) were brought out
as a translation of the <i>Lexikon</i> of Brockhaus; but the direction
was taken over in good time by a group of Russian men
of science, including Mendeléeff, Woiéikoff, V. Solovióff, etc.,
who have made of the 82 volumes of this <i>Dictionary</i>,
completed in 1904 (at 6 sh. the volume)—one of the best
encyclopædias in Europe. Suffice it to say that all articles
on chemistry and chemical technics have been either written
or carefully revised by Mendeléeff.</p>

<p>Complete editions of the works of most of the Russian
writers have lately been published, some of them by the editor
Marks, in connection with his weekly illustrated paper, at
astoundingly low prices, which can only be explained by a
circulation which exceeds 200,000 copies every year. The
work of Gógol, Turguéneff, Gontcharóff, Ostróvskiy, Boborýkin,
Tchéhoff, and some minor writers, like Danilévskiy
and Lyeskóff, are in this case.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> I borrow these remarks about the predecessors of Byelínskiy from
an article on Literary Criticism in Russia, by Professor Ivánoff, in the
<i>Russian Encyclopædic Dictionary</i>, Vol. 32, 771.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> The speech of Homyakóff is reproduced in Skabitchévskiy’s <i>History</i>
(l. c.). I was very anxious to get Tolstóy’s speech, because I
think that the ideas he expressed about “the permanent in Art, the
universal” hardly did exclude the denunciation of the ills from which
a society suffers at a given moment. Perhaps he meant what Nekrásoff
also meant when he described the literature to which Schédrin’s
<i>Provincial Sketches</i> had given origin as “a flagellation of the petty
thieves for the pleasure of the big ones.” Unfortunately, this speech
was not printed, and the manuscript of it could not be found.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
